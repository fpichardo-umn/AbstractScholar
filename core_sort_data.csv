Neural and psychological mechanisms underlying compulsive drug seeking habits and drug memories - indications for novel treatments of addiction*.,,2014,"Everitt, Barry","this review discusses the evidence for the hypothesis that the development of drug addiction can be understood in terms of interactions between pavlovian and instrumental learning and memory mechanisms in the brain that underlie the seeking and taking of drugs. it is argued that these behaviours initially are goal-directed, but increasingly become elicited as stimulus-response habits by drug-associated conditioned stimuli that are established by pavlovian conditioning. it is further argued that compulsive drug use emerges as the result of a loss of prefrontal cortical inhibitory control over drug seeking habits. data are reviewed that indicate these transitions from use to abuse to addiction depend upon shifts from ventral to dorsal striatal control over behaviour, mediated in part by serial connectivity between the striatum and midbrain dopamine systems. only some individuals lose control over their drug use, and the importance of behavioural impulsivity as a vulnerability trait predicting stimulant abuse and addiction in animals and humans, together with consideration of an emerging neuroendophenotype for addiction are discussed. finally, the potential for developing treatments for addiction is considered in light of the neuropsychological advances that are reviewed, including the possibility of targeting drug memory reconsolidation and extinction to reduce pavlovian influences on drug seeking as a means of promoting abstinence and preventing relapse., : corticostriatal circuitry mediating the influence of drug-associated conditioned stimuli on drug seeking actions and habits. interactions between ventral and dorsal striatum via serial connections with midbrain dopamine neurons mediate the progressive shift to control over drug seeking habits by the dorsal striatum that eventually become compulsive through the loss of top-down inhibitory control by prefrontal cortical areas.,",10.1111/ejn.12644,cocaine; relapse; striatum; compulsion; habits; reconsolidation,1343,0,0.464230497,-2.543428803,0.174632353,-11.01443956,-0.243477886,-0.106513703
State-based versus reward-based motivation in younger and older adults.,,2014,"Worthy, Darrell A; Cooper, Jessica A; Byrne, Kaileigh A; Gorlick, Marissa A; Maddox, W.

Novel therapeutics for type 2 diabetes: Incretin hormone mimetics (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors.,,2009,"Verspohl, E.","known treatments of type 2 diabetes mellitus have limitations such as weight gain, and hypoglycaemias. a new perspective is the use of incretin hormones and incretin enhancers. incretins are defined as being responsible for the higher insulin release after an oral glucose load compared to an intravenous glucose load. the delicate balance of glucose homeostasis, in which incretin hormones are involved, is disturbed in type 2 diabetes mellitus. the incretin glp-1 helps to maintain glucose homeostasis through stimulation of insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon release in a glucose-dependent manner. this is associated with reductions in body weight, and no risk of hypoglycaemias. when classical oral agents have failed to maintain adequate glycaemic control, incretin mimetics may be of particular value for obese patients and those who have little control over meal sizes. exenatide was marketed as a glp-1 analogue and longer acting incretin mimetics such as liraglutide, albiglutide and others have the same pharmacological profile., in addition to incretin mimetics incretin enhancers which inhibit/delay degradation of incretins were developed: so-called dpp-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin and vildagliptin are approved in europe. their differences from incretin mimetics include: oral bioavailability, less side effects with overdose, no direct cns effects (nausea and vomiting) and no effect on weight. in rodent models of diabetes, but not yet in humans, glp-1 receptor agonists and dpp-4 inhibitors increase islet mass and preserve [beta]-cell function., incretin mimetics and enhancers expand type 2 diabetes treatment, are still not first line therapy and it is discussed if they are to be prophylactically used.,",10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.06.002,GLP-1; Diabetes; DPP-4; Incretin enhancers; Incretin mimetics,1553,0,0.453491479,-2.513363436,0.22459893,-10.7100442,-0.230346778,-0.0622101
Hot executive function: Emotion and the development of cognitive control.,,2010,"Zelazo, Philip David; Qu, Li; Kesek, Amanda C","young children's ability to act deliberately in light of their knowledge is obviously limited. during the 1st few years of life, however, children change from relatively helpless creatures who must rely on their caregivers to fulfill even their most basic needs into complex intellectual and emotional beings who are able to consider alternative perspectives on a situation, plan ahead, and act in a conscious, goal-directed fashion. these changes in children's behavior are studied under the rubric of executive function (ef). ef is an umbrella term for a number of subfunctions, including, but not limited to, working memory, inhibitory control, and task-switching (miyake, friedman, emerson, witzki, & howerter, 2000). traditionally, research on the development of ef has focused on its relatively cool, cognitive aspects, often associated with lateral prefrontal cortex (pfc) and elicited by relatively abstract, decontextualized tasks. recent work on the development of ef reflects this insight, and there has been growing interest in the development of relatively hot aspects of ef, seen in situations that are emotionally and motivationally significant because they involve meaningful, self-relevant rewards or punishers (e.g., carlson, davis, & leach, 2005; happaney, zelazo, & stuss, 2004; hongwanishkul, happaney, lee, & zelazo, 2005; kerr & zelazo, 2004; zelazo & muller, 2002; zelazo, & cunningham, 2007). we believe that a comprehensive characterization of ef and its development must encompass both hot and cool ef, as demonstrated by the recent work on affective decision making. in this chapter, we first describe a neurodevelopmental model of ef that provides a framework for thinking about how cognitive and emotional aspects of experience interact during the conscious control of thought and behavior, and we then show how this model can be used to make sense of two apparently contradictory effects of emotional context on ef in children: (a) the tendency for motivationally significant rewards to undermine ef and (b) the facilitative effect of positive stimuli on ef. the recent interest in hot ef highlights the relevance of bottom-up, motivational processes in cognitive control and undermines overly rational conceptualizations of ef.",10.1037/12059-006,Models; Behavior; Rewards; Emotions; Cognitive Ability; Motivation; *Executive Function; *Emotional Responses; *Cognitive Development; Neural Development; *Early Childhood Development; *Emotional Development,794,0,0.452929693,-2.404183569,0.174235403,-10.0607475,-0.30224229,-0.100628296
Differences in learning and persistency characterizing behavior in chronic pain for the Iowa Gambling Task: Web-based laboratory-in-the-field study.,,2022,"Zhang, Lili; Vashisht, Himanshu; Nethra, Alekhya; Slattery, Brian; Ward, Tomas","chronic pain is a significant worldwide health problem. it has been reported that people with chronic pain experience decision-making impairments, but these findings have been based on conventional laboratory experiments to date. in such experiments, researchers have extensive control of conditions and can more precisely eliminate potential confounds. in contrast, there is much less known regarding how chronic pain affects decision-making captured via laboratory-in-the-field experiments. although such settings can introduce more experimental uncertainty, collecting data in more ecologically valid contexts can better characterize the real-world impact of chronic pain. we aim to quantify decision-making differences between individuals with chronic pain and healthy controls in a laboratory-in-the-field environment by taking advantage of internet technologies and social media. a cross-sectional design with independent groups was used. a convenience sample of 45 participants was recruited through social media: 20 (44%) participants who self-reported living with chronic pain, and 25 (56%) people with no pain or who were living with pain for < 6 months acting as controls. all participants completed a self-report questionnaire assessing their pain experiences and a neuropsychological task measuring their decision-making (ie, the iowa gambling task) in their web browser at a time and location of their choice without supervision. standard behavioral analysis revealed no differences in learning strategies between the 2 groups, although qualitative differences could be observed in the learning curves. however, computational modeling revealed that individuals with chronic pain were quicker to update their behavior than healthy controls, which reflected their increased learning rate (95% highest-posterior-density interval [hdi] 0.66-0.99) when fitted to the values-plus-perseverance model. this result was further validated and extended on the outcome-representation learning model as higher differences (95% hdi 0.16-0.47) between the reward and punishment learning rates were observed when fitted to this model, indicating that individuals with chronic pain were more sensitive to rewards. it was also found that they were less persistent in their choices during the iowa gambling task compared with controls, a fact reflected by their decreased outcome perseverance (95% hdi -4.38 to -0.21) when fitted using the outcome-representation learning model. moreover, correlation analysis revealed that the estimated parameters had predictive value for the self-reported pain experiences, suggesting that the altered cognitive parameters could be potential candidates for inclusion in chronic pain assessments. we found that individuals with chronic pain were more driven by rewards and less consistent when making decisions in our laboratory-in-the-field experiment. in this case study, it was demonstrated that, compared with standard statistical summaries of behavioral performance, computational approaches offered superior ability to resolve, understand, and explain the differences in decision-making behavior in the context of chronic pain outside the laboratory.",10.2196/26307,*Gambling; *Decision Making; *Learning; *Task; *Chronic Pain; *Pain; *Social Media,114,0,0.452841707,-2.517725399,0.157699443,-11.13409436,-0.226312017,-0.119143541

"""Prediabetes"": Are There Problems With This Label? Yes, the Label Creates Further Problems!!.",,2016,"Yudkin, John",": the category of ""prediabetes"" defined by the american diabetes association comprises a range of intermediate hyperglycemia based on fasting or 2-h postload glucose or on hba1c. over the recent past, the ""cut points"" identifying this stage have changed, i.e., a lower fasting glucose level is used. on one hand, it can be argued that the change to a lower cut point identifies a group of individuals still at higher risk and provides heightened awareness for a condition associated with higher risk for cardiovascular disease. in addition, identification of individuals at this stage may represent a chance of earlier intervention in the disease. however, the argument against this definition of ""prediabetes"" is that it disguises the differences in the three subcategories and creates problems in interpreting observations on interventions and outcomes. in addition, it can be argued that the enormous numbers of people identified with the criteria far exceeds the capacity of health care systems to respond through individual care, particularly without evidence that interventions benefit any category other than impaired glucose tolerance. thus, there does not appear to be consensus on the definition using the cut points identified. controversy also remains as to whether there are glycemic metrics beyond hba1c that can be used in addition to hba1c to help assess risk of an individual developing diabetes complications. given the current controversy, a point-counterpoint debate on this issue is provided herein. in the point narrative below, dr. yudkin provides his argument that there are significant problems with this label. in the counterpoint narrative that follows dr. yudkin's contribution, dr. cefalu argues that the cut points are appropriate and do provide useful and important information in trying to reduce the future burden of diabetes., -william t. cefalu, editor in chief, diabetes care,",10.2337/dc15-2113,,1272,0,0.452140824,-2.502694846,0.146616541,-11.47487854,-0.260295237,-0.139533407

Family history of depression is associated with alterations in task-dependent connectivity between the cerebellum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.,,2021,"Tepfer, LJ; Alloy, LB; Smith, DV","A family history of major depressive disorder (MDD) increases the likelihood of a future depressive episode, which itself poses a significant risk for disruptions in reward processing and social cognition. However, it is unclear whether a family history of MDD is associated with alterations in the neural circuitry underlying reward processing and social cognition.

Methods
We subdivided 279 participants from the Human Connectome Project into three groups: 71 with a lifetime history of MDD, 103 with a family history (FH) of MDD, and 105 healthy controls (HCs). We then evaluated task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging data on a social cognition and a reward processing task and found a region of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) that responded to both tasks, independent of the group. To investigate whether the vmPFC shows alterations in functional connectivity between groups, we conducted psychophysiological interaction analyses using the vmPFC as a seed region.

Results
We found that FH (relative to HC) was associated with increased sadness scores, and MDD (relative to both FH and HC) was associated with increased sadness and MDD symptoms. Additionally, the FH group had increased vmPFC functional connectivity within the nucleus accumbens, left dorsolateral PFC, and subregions of the cerebellum relative to HC during the social cognition task.

Conclusions
These findings suggest that aberrant neural mechanisms among those with a familial risk of MDD may underlie vulnerability to altered social cognition.",10.1002/da.23143,fMRI; functional connectivity; family history; depression,1060,0,0.437305976,-2.497888651,0.157992565,-10.73987686,-0.227206804,-0.116998609

Blunted response to feedback information in depressive illness.,,2007,"Steele, J.; Kumar, P.; Ebmeier, K.","depressive illness is associated with sustained widespread cognitive deficits, in addition to repeated experience of distressing emotions. an accepted theory, which broadly accounts for features of the syndrome, and its delayed response to antidepressant medication, is lacking. one possibility, which has received considerable attention, is that depressive illness is associated with a specific underlying deficit: a blunted or impaired ability to respond to feedback information. unlike healthy controls, if patients with a depressive illness commit an error, they can be at increased risk of committing a subsequent error, possibly due to a failure to adjust performance in order to reduce the risk of error. in some speeded tasks, performance adjustment in humans is reliably associated with trial-to-trial change in reaction times (rts), such as 'post-error slowing'. previous studies of abnormal response to feedback have not investigated rt change in any detail. we used a combination of quantitative modelling of rts and fmri in 15 patients and 14 matched controls to test the hypothesis that depressive illness was associated with a blunted behavioural and neural response to feedback information during a gambling task. the results supported the hypothesis. controls responded to negative ('lose') feedback by an increase in rt and activation of the anterior cingulate, the extent of which correlated with rt change. patients did not significantly increase their rts, nor activate the anterior cingulate. controls responded to positive ('win') feedback by a reduction in rt and activation of the ventral striatum, the extent of which correlated with rt change. patients neither reduced their rt nor activated the ventral striatum. rt adjustment correlated with self-reported anhedonia for both patients and controls. this behavioural deficit, together with its associated pattern of abnormal neural activity, implies that the anterior midline cortical substrate for error correction, which includes projections from the monoamine systems, is dysfunctional in depressive illness. many studies have reported abnormalities of the medial frontal cortex in depressive illness; however, the mechanism by which antidepressant medication acts via the monoamine systems remains elusive. our results suggest a direct link between the core subjective symptom of anhedonia, replicated neuropsychological deficits, electrophysiological and imaging abnormalities, and hypothesized dysfunction of the error correction system.,",10.1093/brain/awm150,ventral striatum; major depressive disorder; functional imaging; medial frontal cortex; phasic monoamine activity,1611,0,0.424433313,-2.44461037,0.174471993,-11.06497772,-0.231457758,-0.110513548

Towards a neuro-computational account of prism adaptation.,,2018,"Petitet, Pierre; O'Reilly, Jill; O'Shea, Jacinta","prism adaptation has a long history as an experimental paradigm used to investigate the functional and neural processes that underlie sensorimotor control. in the neuropsychology literature, prism adaptation behaviour is typically explained by reference to a traditional cognitive psychology framework that distinguishes putative functions, such as 'strategic control' versus 'spatial realignment'. this theoretical framework lacks conceptual clarity, quantitative precision and explanatory power. here, we advocate for an alternative computational framework that offers several advantages: 1) an algorithmic explanatory account of the computations and operations that drive behaviour; 2) expressed in quantitative mathematical terms; 3) embedded within a principled theoretical framework (bayesian decision theory, state-space modelling); 4) that offers a means to generate and test quantitative behavioural predictions. this computational framework offers a route towards mechanistic neurocognitive explanations of prism adaptation behaviour. thus it constitutes a conceptual advance compared to the traditional theoretical framework. in this paper, we illustrate how bayesian decision theory and state-space models offer principled explanations for a range of behavioural phenomena in the field of prism adaptation (e.g. visual capture, magnitude of visual versus proprioceptive realignment, spontaneous recovery and dynamics of adaptation memory). we argue that this explanatory framework can advance understanding of the functional and neural mechanisms that implement prism adaptation behaviour, by enabling quantitative tests of hypotheses that go beyond merely descriptive mapping claims that 'brain area x is (somehow) involved in psychological process y'., highlights:, traditional neuropsychological models of prism adaptation lack precision., computational models improve explanatory and predictive power., a range of adaptation phenomena can be explained quantitatively., mathematics offers a bridge between neural mechanisms and behaviour., * a neuro-computational approach will advance neuropsychology.,",10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.12.021,Computational neuroscience; Prism adaptation; Sensorimotor control,1181,0,0.422700351,-2.559553619,0.163452709,-10.78339705,-0.3342427,-0.146730914
How similarity between choice options affects decisions from experience: The accentuation-of-differences model.,,2019,"Spektor, Mikhail S; Gluth, Sebastian; Fontanesi, Laura; Rieskamp, Jorg","traditional theories of decision making require that humans evaluate choice options independently of each other. the independence principle underlying this notion states that the relative choice probability of two options should be independent of the choice set. previous research demonstrated systematic violations of this principle in decisions from description (context effects), leading to the development of various models explaining them. yet, the cognitive processes underlying multi-alternative decisions from experience remain unclear. furthermore, it is not known whether context effects also occur in such decisions, and existing learning models do not predict them. in three experiments, the similarity effect, compromise effect, and attraction effect were explored in a 3-armed bandit task with full feedback. participants' behavior systematically violated the independence principle, although mostly not in line with past context-effect patterns in decisions from description. the observed similarity effect and the reversals of the compromise and the attraction effects can be explained by a similarity mechanism, according to which options with similar outcomes appear less attractive. we propose the accentuation-of-differences model that relies on this mechanism. we further validated the model in a fourth experiment in which we demonstrated a new violation of independence, the accentuation effect. across all experiments, the model outperformed traditional reinforcement-learning models in describing the observed findings. finally, the model's generalizability was confirmed using the iowa gambling task. in summary, the present work is the first to demonstrate systematic violations of the independence principle in various decisions-from-experience designs and to offer a model to explain the observed phenomena.",10.1037/rev0000122,Cognitive Processes; *Choice Behavior; *Decision Making; *Learning; Reinforcement; *Decision Theory; Probability; Feedback; *Stimulus Similarity,328,0,0.421812533,-2.549531615,0.127579737,-11.45856169,-0.225490194,-0.158676663

Going beyond cognitive approach to behavioral stream in economic sciences: Behavioristic and evolutionary perspectives.,,2020,"Korzeniowska, Dominika; Su_kowski, _ukasz","the paper is a proposal of the triangulation of a theory basis for the behavioral stream in economic sciences that currently mostly uses a cognitive approach, by adopting a behavioristic and evolutionary perspective into that scope of reflection. a narrative literature review of scientific databases by means of internet search engines based on the combinations of relevant keywords was used. the final selection included 37 articles and 21 monographs subjected to further analysis. the analysis showed that by adopting other perspectives than just a cognitive one into behavioral economics research can enrich theoretical and empirical foundations, provide new research tools, and enable discoveries on human economic behaviors. evolutionary concepts also seem to gain in importance nowadays, especially in terms of neuroscientific methods used to investigate how the human brain functions. the combination of all three approaches seems quite promising and worth further development, as it may lead to not only uncovering the mechanisms underlying economic behaviors but also may help people to make better decisions. thanks to the combination of the three approaches (paradigms) pictured together (which has not previously been present in the literature on the subject), the paper aims to inspire behavioral economic researchers to search for the theoretical basis of their scientific quest going beyond the cognitive canon, to facilitate embedding their studies in a proper paradigm or finding the relevant concept/theory, and also recognizing niche or complementary research areas. therefore, the article adds to a discussion on the theoretical foundations of the stream and the process of shaping its scientific identity.

Identifying new susceptibility genes on dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways for the framing effect in decision-making.,,2017,"Gao, X; Liu, J; Gong, P; Wang, J; Fang, W; Yan, H; Zhu, L; Zhou, X","The framing effect refers the tendency to be risk-averse when options are presented positively but be risk-seeking when the same options are presented negatively during decision-making. This effect has been found to be modulated by the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) and the catechol-o-methyltransferase gene (COMT) polymorphisms, which are on the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways and which are associated with affective processing. The current study aimed to identify new genetic variations of genes on dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways that may contribute to individual differences in the susceptibility to framing. Using genome-wide association data and the gene-based principal components regression method, we examined genetic variations of 26 genes on the pathways in 1317 Chinese Han participants. Consistent with previous studies, we found that the genetic variations of the SLC6A4 gene and the COMT gene were associated with the framing effect. More importantly, we demonstrated that the genetic variations of the aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (DDC) gene, which is involved in the synthesis of both dopamine and serotonin, contributed to individual differences in the susceptibility to framing.

More recently, we proposed that the catecholamines might modulate value-based decision-making about whether or not to engage in cognitive control. We test this hypothesis by assessing effects of a catecholamine challenge in a large sample of young, healthy adults (n = 100) on the avoidance of a cognitively demanding control process: task switching. Prolonging catecholamine transmission by blocking reuptake with methylphenidate altered the avoidance, but not the execution of cognitive control. Crucially, these effects could be isolated by taking into account individual differences in trait impulsivity, so that participants with higher trait impulsivity became more avoidant of cognitive control, despite faster task performance.

Editorial: bridging the gap with computational and translational psychopharmacology.,,2019,"Flagel, SB; Gordon, JA; Paulus, MP","The application of theoretical and computational approaches to the analysis of complex behavior has a rich history in psychology. A shining example of this is the modeling of learning encapsulated elegantly by Rescorla and Wagner (1972), who demonstrated that classical conditioning can be described by a simple mathematical equation. The explanatory power of the Rescorla-Wagner rule and its subsequent expansion into additional areas of behavioral plasticity has enabled the precise mapping of learning parameters onto neural structures and even individual neurons. A plethora of other mathematical models have since been used to describe a variety of behaviors, and to map those behaviors onto their underlying neurobiology. This so-called computational phenotyping is now gaining momentum as a translational tool that can be used to identify process characteristics in both humans and animals with the potential of transforming the field of psychopharmacology. The contributions to this Special Issue on Computational and Translational Psychopharmacology stem from the European Behavioural Pharmacology Society (EBPS) Workshop that was held at the University of Cambridge, in August of 2018.

Competing neurobehavioral decision systems and the neuroeconomics of craving in opioid addiction.,,2014,"Jarmolowicz, DP; Sofis, M; Martin, L","Craving is typically thought of as a classically conditioned response characterized by an elevated mesolimbic dopamine response to drug-related stimuli. Although this definition has spurred considerable research, the clinical impact of the research conducted has been less robust. The current review takes a more contemporary approach by conceptualizing craving as the breakdown of executive function and relative strengthening of the limbic system, occurring in the presence of conditioned cues, leading to a maladaptive craving response (ie, an increased likelihood of drug consumption). Working from this framework, the present review focuses on four issues in drug craving research: pivotal findings and limitations of cue-reactivity and neurocognitive tasks; two main processes of craving that include self-control and reward-based explanations; integration of neuroeconomic approaches to craving; and the theoretical implications and future directions of drug craving research.",10.2147/NAN.S38866,"craving, competing decision systems, executive function, loss of control, substance abuse",2130,0,0.336372639,-2.559980847,0.14379085,-12.55006732,-0.164677399,-0.175853892

Decision-making inflexibility in a reversal learning task is associated with severity of problem gambling symptoms but not with a diagnosis of substance use disorder.,,2020,"Jara-Rizzo, Maria F; Navas, Juan F; Rodas, Jose A; Perales, Jose C","decisions made by individuals with disordered gambling are markedly inflexible. however, whether anomalies in learning from feedback are gambling-specific, or extend beyond gambling contexts, remains an open question. more generally, addictive disorders-including gambling disorder-have been proposed to be facilitated by individual differences in feedback-driven decision-making inflexibility, which has been studied in the lab with the probabilistic reversal learning task (prlt). in this task, participants are first asked to learn which of two choice options is more advantageous, on the basis of trial-by-trial feedback, but, once preferences are established, reward contingencies are reversed, so that the advantageous option becomes disadvantageous and vice versa. inflexibility is revealed by a less effective reacquisition of preferences after reversal, which can be distinguished from more generalized learning deficits. in the present study, we compared prlt performance across two groups of 25 treatment-seeking patients diagnosed with an addictive disorder and who reported gambling problems, and 25 matched controls [18 males/7 females in both groups, mage(sdage) = 25.24 (8.42) and 24.96 (7.90), for patients and controls, respectively]. beyond testing for differences in the shape of prlt learning curves across groups, the specific effect of problematic gambling symptoms' severity was also assessed independently of group assignment. in order to surpass previous methodological problems, full acquisition and reacquisition curves were fitted using generalized mixed-effect models. results showed that (1) controls did not significantly differ from patients in global prlt performance nor showed specific signs of decision-making inflexibility; and (2) regardless of whether group affiliation was controlled for or not, gambling severity was specifically associated with more inefficient learning in phases with reversed contingencies. conclusion: decision-making inflexibility, as revealed by difficulty to reacquire decisional preferences based on feedback after contingency reversals, seems to be associated with gambling problems, but not necessarily with a substance-use disorder diagnosis. this result aligns with gambling disorder models in which domain-general compulsivity is linked to vulnerability to develop gambling-specific problems with exposure to gambling opportunities.",10.1186/s40359-020-00482-6,Gambling; Addiction; *Decision Making; *Gambling Disorder; *Reversal Shift Learning; Probability; Feedback,244,0,0.320773073,-2.617212556,0.13197026,-10.20811523,-0.541720753,-0.246141062

A model of the initial stages of drug abuse: From reinforcement learning to social contagion.,,2011,"Koritzky, Gilly; Luria, Adi; Yechiam, Eldad","this chapter proposes a decision-making model of sensitivity to drug abuse among high-functioning individuals. the model suggests that individuals at risk for drug abuse have an increased tendency to respond to gains when they are salient. we presented two factors that increase this salience, both of which have ecological similarity to features of typical drug use situations, risky alternatives that produce favorable outcomes for the majority of the time and foregone payoffs that highlight the positive counterfactuals of such risky alternatives. these factors are involved in situations of social exposure to drug use, where individuals observe salient gains that are favorable in the immediate range. either alone or interactively, they increase individuals' propensity to use drugs. social exposure is therefore suggested as a replacement process by which a person receives information about the consequences of drug use even if he or she has sufficient resolution to avoid the particular drug. this is consistent with the effect of the drugs that are commonly consumed in the company of other people. the most popular explanation for why certain drugs are ""social"" involves their low price (wdr, 2006). we propose an alternative explanation based on the fact that the typical outcomes from social drugs, such as cocaine and marijuana, tend to be rewarding. furthermore, notice that unlike other drugs, these drugs do not involve negative effects that are immediately observable (e.g., skin abrasion or pain). hence, social drugs fall into the category of behaviors that, although risky and maladaptive, result in favorable outcomes most of the time. according to the model presented in this chapter, these are the behaviors most prone to being induced by observing others.",10.1002/9781118101803.ch11,Decision Making; *Social Behavior; Reinforcement; *Drug Abuse; *Contagion,749,0,0.320309328,-2.583914203,0.108365019,-11.60144807,-0.31933291,-0.231360391

Reinforcement learning models of risky choice and the promotion of risk-taking by losses disguised as wins in rats.,,2017,"Marshall, Andrew T; Kirkpatrick, Kimberly","risky decisions are inherently characterized by the potential to receive gains or incur losses, and these outcomes have distinct effects on subsequent decision-making. one important factor is that individuals engage in loss-chasing, in which the reception of a loss is followed by relatively increased risk-taking. unfortunately, the mechanisms of loss-chasing are poorly understood, despite the potential importance for understanding pathological choice behavior. the goal of the present experiment was to illuminate the mechanisms governing individual differences in loss-chasing and risky-choice behaviors. rats chose between a low-uncertainty outcome that always delivered a variable amount of reward and a high-uncertainty outcome that probabilistically delivered reward. loss-processing and loss-chasing were assessed in the context of losses disguised as wins (ldws), which are loss outcomes that are presented along with gain-related stimuli. ldws have been suggested to interfere with adaptive decision-making in humans and thus potentially increase loss-making. here, the rats presented with ldws were riskier, in that they made more choices for the high-uncertainty outcome. a series of nonlinear models were fit to individual rats' data to elucidate the possible psychological mechanisms that best account for individual differences in high-uncertainty choices and loss-chasing behaviors. the models suggested that the rats presented with ldws were more prone to showing a stay bias following high-uncertainty outcomes compared to rats not presented with ldws. these results collectively suggest that ldws acquire conditioned reinforcement properties that encourage continued risk-taking and increase loss-chasing following previous high-risk decisions.",10.1037/xan0000141,Decision Making; Rats; *Choice Behavior; *Reinforcement; *Risk Taking; *Animal Learning; *Classical Conditioning,431,0,0.319275687,-2.519302912,0.155430712,-11.43991691,-0.251774306,-0.173480607

Dissociable processes underlying decisions in the Iowa Gambling Task: A new integrative framework.,,2009,"Stocco, Andrea; Fum, Danilo; Napoli, Antonio","the iowa gambling task (igt) is a common paradigm used to study the interactions between emotions and decision making, yet little consensus exists on the cognitive process determining participants' decisions, what affects them, and how these processes interact with each other. a novel conceptual framework is proposed according to which behavior in the igt reflects a balance between two dissociable processes; a cognitively demanding process that tracks each option's long-term payoff, and a lower-level, automatic process that is primarily sensitive to loss frequency and magnitude. a behavioral experiment was carried out with a modified version of igt. in this modified version, participants went through an additional phase of interaction, designed to measure performance without further learning, in which no feedback on individual decisions was given. a secondary distractor task was presented in either the first or the second phase of the experiment. behavioral measures of performance tracking both payoff and frequency sensitivity in choices were collected throughout the experiment. consistent with our framework, the results confirmed that: (a) the two competing cognitive processes can be dissociated; (b) that learning from decision outcomes requires central cognitive resources to estimate long-term payoff; and (c) that the decision phase itself can be carried out during an interfering task once learning has occurred. conclusion: the experimental results support our novel description of the cognitive processes underlying performance in the iowa gambling task. they also suggest that patients' impairments in this and other gambling paradigms can originate from a number of different causes, including a failure in allocating resources among cognitive strategies. this latter interpretation might be particularly useful in explaining the impairments of patients with ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions and, by extension, the contribution of this brain region to human decision making.",10.1186/1744-9081-5-1,Decision Making; Gambling; *Performance; *Cognitive Processes,845,0,0.312789391,-2.560590927,0.182481752,-11.29971947,-0.409766496,-0.191735469

"Suboptimal Choice, Reward-Predictive Signals, and Temporal Information.",,2018,"Cunningham, PJ; Shahan, TA","Suboptimal choice refers to preference for an alternative offering a low probability of food (suboptimal alternative) over an alternative offering a higher probability of food (optimal alternative). Numerous studies have found that stimuli signaling probabilistic food play a critical role in the development and maintenance of suboptimal choice. However, there is still much debate about how to characterize how these stimuli influence suboptimal choice. There is substantial evidence that the temporal information conveyed by a food-predictive signal governs its function as both a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus and as an instrumental conditioned reinforcer. Thus, we explore the possibility that food-predictive signals influence suboptimal choice via the temporal information they convey. Application of this temporal information-theoretic approach to suboptimal choice provides a formal, quantitative framework that describes how food-predictive signals influence suboptimal choice in a manner consistent with related phenomena in Pavlovian conditioning and conditioned reinforcement. Our reanalysis of previous data on suboptimal choice suggests that, generally speaking, preference in the suboptimal choice procedure tracks relative temporal information conveyed by food-predictive signals for the suboptimal and optimal alternatives. The model suggests that suboptimal choice develops when the food-predictive signal for the suboptimal alternative conveys more temporal information than that for the optimal alternative. Finally, incorporating a role for competition between temporal information provided by food-predictive signals and relative primary reinforcement rate provides a reasonable account of existing data on suboptimal choice",10.1037/xan0000160,conditioned reinforcement; suboptimal choice; information theory; temporal information; Pavlovian conditioning,1205,0,0.304194432,-2.478162488,0.097087379,-10.78134937,-0.358887286,-0.235132818
Towards a cognitive architecture for the maintenance of attentional bias for threat in anxiety: A model comparison approach.,,2015,"Coussement, Charlotte; Heeren, Alexandre","recently, researchers started to investigate the causal nature of attentional bias for threat (ab) in the maintenance of anxiety disorders, by experimentally manipulating it. they found that training anxious individuals to attend to non-threat stimuli reduces ab, which, in turn, improves anxiety. this effect supports the hypothesis that ab can causally impact on the maintenance of anxiety. at a fundamental level, however, uncertainty still abounds regarding the nature of the processes that underlie ab and its plasticity. according to one approach, the maintenance of ab is the result of the activation of a valence evaluation system. according to another approach, ab involves an impaired recruitment of top-down control the main god of the present theoretical paper is to put these two approaches, one against the other. specifically, the article is structured around three major issues. first, we will debate the possibility that ab may also result from an impaired valence evaluation system. then, we will discuss the hypothesis that the reduction of ab requires top-down executive control. finally, we will explore the potential interactions between these two contrasting approaches in the onset and the maintenance of ab. we will also discuss the potential impact of these two approaches in the understanding of the other types of cognitive biases.",10.4074/S0003503315000202,*Cognitive Bias; *Threat; *Anxiety Disorders; *Attentional Bias,523,0,0.303660987,-2.614321993,0.131208997,-11.48652189,-0.296208345,-0.214241295

Cumulative gains enhance striatal response to reward opportunities in alcohol-dependent patients.,,2015,"Gilman, Jodi M; Smith, Ashley R; Bjork, James M; Ramchandani, Vijay A; Momenan, Reza; Hommer, Daniel W","substance use disorder is characterized by a transition from volitional to compulsive responding for drug reward. a possible explanation for this transition may be that alcohol-dependent patients (adp) show a general propensity for a history of rewarded instrumental responses, and these rewarded responses may boost the activation of motivational neurocircuitry for additional reward. brain imaging studies of decision-making have demonstrated that adp relative to controls (con) often show altered neural activation in response to anticipating and receiving rewards, but the majority of studies have not investigated how past performance affects activation. a potential exists for adp to show increased sensitivity to reward as a function of reward delivery history. in the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural correlates of risky decision-making in adp (n = 18) and con (n = 18) while they played a two-choice monetary risk-taking game. in addition to investigating general neural recruitment by risky decision-making, we also modeled each participant's running total of monetary earnings in order to determine areas of activation that correlated with cumulative reward. we found that adp and con showed few differences in behavior or in mesolimbic activation by choice for, and receipt of, risky gains. however, when including a cumulative-earnings covariate, adp exhibited heightened striatal activation that correlated with total earnings during the choice event in the task. the heightened contextual sensitivity of striatal responses to cumulative earnings in adp may represent a general neurobiological affective substrate for development of automatized instrumental behavior.",10.1111/adb.12147,Rewards; *Decision Making; *Risk Taking; *Neural Networks; *Alcoholism; Basal Ganglia,601,0,0.299463608,-2.569318815,0.142322097,-12.00723704,-0.271905564,-0.205975317

Failing as Doorman and Disc Jockey at the Same Time: Amygdalar Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease.,,2016,"Diederich, Nico; Goldman, Jennifer; MD, MS; Stebbins, Glenn; Goetz, Christopher; MD, FAAN",": in braak's model of ascending degeneration in parkinson's disease (pd), involvement of the amygdala occurs simultaneously with substantia nigra degeneration. however, the clinical manifestations of amygdalar involvement in pd have not been fully delineated. considered a multitask manager, the amygdala is a densely connected ""hub,"" coordinating and integrating tasks ranging from prompt, multisensorial emotion recognition to adequate emotional responses and emotional tuning of memories. although phylogenetically predisposed to handle fear, the amygdala handles both aversive and positive emotional inputs. in pd, neuropathological and in vivo studies suggest primarily amygdalar hypofunction. however, as dopamine acts as an inverted u-shaped amygdalar modulator, medication-induced hyperactivity of the amygdala can occur. we propose that amygdalar (network) dysfunction contributes to reduced recognition of negative emotional face expressions, impaired theory of mind, reactive hypomimia, and impaired decision making. similarly, impulse control disorders in predisposed individuals, hallucinations, anxiety, and panic attacks may be related to amygdalar dysfunction. when available, we discuss amygdala-independent trigger mechanisms of these symptoms. although dopaminergic agents have mostly an activation effect on amygdalar function, adaptive and compensatory network changes may occur as well, but these have not been sufficiently explored. in conclusion, our model of amygdalar involvement brings together several elements of parkinson's disease phenomenology heretofore left unexplained and provides a framework for testable hypotheses in patients during life and in autopsy analyses.",10.1002/mds.26460,amygdala; anxiety; emotional face recognition; hallucinations; impulse control disorders,1298,0,0.298601991,-2.61902498,0.140740741,-11.10719876,-0.323565287,-0.209639199
[beta]-Cell failure in type 2 diabetes.,,2011,"Leibowitz, Gil; Kaiser, Nurit; Cerasi, Erol",": type 2 diabetic patients are insulin resistant as a result of obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. nevertheless, it has been known for the past five decades that insulin response to nutrients is markedly diminished in type 2 diabetes. there is now a consensus that impaired glucose regulation cannot develop without insulin deficiency. first-phase insulin response to glucose is lost very early in the development of type 2 diabetes. several prospective studies have shown that impaired insulin response to glucose is a predictor of future impaired glucose tolerance (igt) and type 2 diabetes. recently discovered type 2 diabetes-risk gene variants influence [beta]-cell function, and might represent the molecular basis for the low insulin secretion that predicts future type 2 diabetes. we believe type 2 diabetes develops on the basis of normal but 'weak'[beta]-cells unable to cope with excessive functional demands imposed by overnutrition and insulin resistance. several laboratories have shown a reduction in [beta]-cell mass in type 2 diabetes and igt, whereas others have found modest reductions and most importantly, a large overlap between [beta]-cell masses of diabetic and normoglycemic subjects. therefore, at least initially, the [beta]-cell dysfunction of type 2 diabetes seems more functional than structural. however, type 2 diabetes is a progressive disorder, and animal models of diabetes show [beta]-cell apoptosis with prolonged hyperglycemia/hyperlipemia (glucolipotoxicity). [beta]-cells exposed in vitro to glucolipotoxic conditions show endoplasmic reticulum (er) and oxidative stress. er stress mechanisms might participate in the adaptation of [beta]-cells to hyperglycemia, unless excessive. [beta]-cells are not deficient in anti-oxidant defense, thioredoxin playing a major role. its inhibitor, thioredoxin-interacting protein (txnip), might be important in leading to [beta]-cell apoptosis and type 2 diabetes. these topics are intensively investigated and might lead to novel therapeutic approaches.

Should We Control? The Interplay Between Cognitive Control and Information Integration in the Resolution of the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma.,,2019,"Cogliati Dezza, I; Cleeremans, A; Alexander, W","In their daily decisions, humans and animals are often confronted with the conflicting choice of opting either for a rewarding familiar option (i.e., exploitation) or for a novel, uncertain option that may, however, yield a better reward in the near future (i.e., exploration). Despite extensive research, the cognitive mechanisms that subtend the manner in which humans solve this exploration-exploitation dilemma are still poorly understood. In this study, we challenge the popular assumption that exploitation is a global default strategy that must be suppressed by means of cognitive control mechanisms so as to enable exploratory strategies. To do so, we asked participants to engage in a challenging working memory task while performing repeated choices in a gambling task. Results showed that manipulating cognitive control resources exclusively hindered participantsÃÂÃÂ ability to explore the environment in a directed, intentional manner. Moreover, under certain scenarios, adopting exploitative strategies was also dependent on the availability of cognitive control resources. Additional analyses using a recent computational model of information integration suggests that increasing cognitive load specifically interferes with the ability to combine reward and information in order to inform choices.

The Information Sampling Test was used to assess reflection impulsivity in 175 adolescents (mean age 18.3, range 16.5ÃÂÃÂ20; 55% female)ÃÂÃÂ48 cannabis users (2.3 years use, 10.8 days/month), 65 alcohol users, and 62 non-substance-using controlsÃÂÃÂrecruited from a longitudinal cohort and from the general community and matched for education and IQ.

Results
Cannabis users sampled to the lowest degree of certainty before making a decision on the task. Group differences remained significant after controlling for relevant substance use and clinical confounds (e.g., anxiety, depressive symptoms, alcohol, and ecstasy use). Poor performance on multiple IST indices was associated with an earlier age of onset of regular cannabis use and greater duration of exposure to cannabis, after controlling for recent use. Alcohol users did not differ from controls on any IST measure.

Conclusions
Exposure to cannabis during adolescence is associated with increased risky and impulsive decision making, with users adopting strategies with higher levels of uncertainty and inefficient utilisation of information. The young cannabis users did show sensitivity to losses, suggesting that greater impulsivity early in their drug using career is more evident when there is a lack of negative consequences.

The changing face of diabetes in youth: lessons learned from studies of type 2 diabetes.,,2015,"Hannon, Tamara; Arslanian, Silva",": the incidence of youth type 2 diabetes (t2d), linked with obesity and declining physical activity in high-risk populations, is increasing. recent multicenter studies have led to a number of advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and complications of this disease. as in adult t2d, youth t2d is associated with insulin resistance, together with progressive deterioration in [beta] cell function and relative insulin deficiency in the absence of diabetes-related immune markers. in contrast to adult t2d, the decline in [beta] cell function in youth t2d is three- to fourfold faster, and therapeutic failure rates are significantly higher in youth than in adults. whether the more aggressive nature of youth t2d is driven by genetic heterogeneity or physiology/metabolic maladaptation is yet unknown. besides metformin, the lack of approved pharmacotherapeutic agents for youth t2d that target the pathophysiological mechanisms is a major barrier to optimal diabetes management. there is a significant need for effective therapeutic options, in addition to increased prevention, to halt the projected fourfold increase in youth t2d by 2050 and the consequences of heightened diabetes-related morbidity and mortality at younger ages.,",10.1111/nyas.12939,adolescent; obesity; treatment; insulin secretion; insulin sensitivity; pathophysiology,1304,0,0.276847153,-2.513098835,0.108003857,-13.08537837,-0.16367753,-0.226417969

[beta]-Cell Failure in Diabetes and Preservation by Clinical Treatment.,,2007,"Wajchenberg, Bernardo","there is a progressive deterioration in [beta]-cell function and mass in type 2 diabetics. it was found that islet function was about 50% of normal at the time of diagnosis, and a reduction in [beta]-cell mass of about 60% was shown at necropsy. the reduction of [beta]-cell mass is attributable to accelerated apoptosis. the major factors for progressive loss of [beta]-cell function and mass are glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, proinflammatory cytokines, leptin, and islet cell amyloid. impaired [beta]-cell function and possibly [beta]-cell mass appear to be reversible, particularly at early stages of the disease where the limiting threshold for reversibility of decreased [beta]-cell mass has probably not been passed., among the interventions to preserve or ""rejuvenate"" [beta]-cells, short-term intensive insulin therapy of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes will improve [beta]-cell function, usually leading to a temporary remission time. another intervention is the induction of [beta]-cell ""rest"" by selective activation of atp-sensitive k+ (katp) channels, using drugs such as diazoxide., a third type of intervention is the use of antiapoptotic drugs, such as the thiazolidinediones (tzds), and incretin mimetics and enhancers, which have demonstrated significant clinical evidence of effects on human [beta]-cell function., the tzds improve insulin secretory capacity, decrease [beta]-cell apoptosis, and reduce islet cell amyloid with maintenance of neogenesis. the tzds have indirect effects on [beta]-cells by being insulin sensitizers. the direct effects are via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [gamma] activation in pancreatic islets, with tzds consistently improving basal [beta]-cell function. these beneficial effects are sustained in some individuals with time. there are several trials on prevention of diabetes with tzds., incretin hormones, which are released from the gastrointestinal tract in response to nutrient ingestion to enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the pancreas, aid the overall maintenance of glucose homeostasis through slowing of gastric emptying, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and control of body weight. from the two major incretins, glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip), only the first one or its mimetics or enhancers can be used for treatment because the diabetic [beta]-cell is resistant to gip action. because of the rapid inactivation of glp-1 by dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp)-iv, several incretin analogs were developed: glp-1 receptor agonists (incretin mimetics) exenatide (synthetic exendin-4) and liraglutide, by conjugation of glp-1 to circulating albumin. the acute effect of glp-1 and glp-1 receptor agonists on [beta]-cells is stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin release, followed by enhancement of insulin biosynthesis and stimulation of insulin gene transcription. the chronic action is stimulating [beta]-cell proliferation, induction of islet neogenesis, and inhibition of [beta]-cell apoptosis, thus promoting expansion of [beta]-cell mass, as observed in rodent diabetes and in cultured [beta]-cells. exenatide and liraglutide enhanced postprandial [beta]-cell function., the inhibition of the activity of the dpp-iv enzyme enhances endogenous glp-1 action in vivo, mediated not only by glp-1 but also by other mediators. in preclinical studies, oral active dpp-iv inhibitors (sitagliptin and vildagliptin) also promoted [beta]-cell proliferation, neogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis in rodents. meal tolerance tests showed improvement in postprandial [beta]-cell function., obviously, it is difficult to estimate the protective effects of incretin mimetics and enhancers on [beta]-cells in humans, and there is no clinical evidence that these drugs really have protective effects on [beta]-cells.,",10.1210/10.1210/er.2006-0038,,1621,0,0.274138404,-2.59589436,0.131702728,-11.0906357,-0.337063279,-0.225580871

IFG was associated with a higher systolic blood pressure, higher concentrations of HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide (P_<_.0001) and triglycerides (P_=_.03), and lower HOMA2-IS and HOMA2-B (P_<_.0001) independent of sex, age, puberty, waist-to-height ratio, and degree of obesity. Furthermore, IFG was associated with a higher risk for hypertension (OR_=_1.66 [95%CI: 1.21; 2.28], P_=_.002) and dyslipidemia (OR_=_1.90 [95%CI: 1.38; 2.56], P_<_.0001) compared with the group without IFG independent of age, sex, and puberty.

Conclusions
The prevalence of IFG, when applying the ADA criterion compared with the WHO criterion, was 4 times higher in individuals with overweight and obesity and 14 times higher in individuals with normal weight in this study sample of children and adolescents. IFG was associated with a higher risk of hypertension and dyslipidemia compared with their normoglycemic peers regardless of the definition applied",10.1111/pedi.12604,obesity; children; glucose metabolism; impaired fasting glucose,1190,0,0.27236633,-2.571351487,0.186131387,-10.1949119,-0.271796643,-0.154925563

Determining the relationship between dietary carbohydrate intake and insulin resistance.,,2005,Neville H.

The influence of trial order on learning from reward vs. punishment in a probabilistic categorization task: Experimental and computational analyses.,,2015,"Moustafa, Ahmed A; Gluck, Mark A; Herzallah, Mohammad M; Myers, Catherine E","previous research has shown that trial ordering affects cognitive performance, but this has not been tested using category-learning tasks that differentiate learning from reward and punishment. here, we tested two groups of healthy young adults using a probabilistic category learning task of reward and punishment in which there are two types of trials (reward, punishment) and three possible outcomes: (1) positive feedback for correct responses in reward trials; (2) negative feedback for incorrect responses in punishment trials; and (3) no feedback for incorrect answers in reward trials and correct answers in punishment trials. hence, trials without feedback are ambiguous, and may represent either successful avoidance of punishment or failure to obtain reward. in experiment 1, the first group of subjects received an intermixed task in which reward and punishment trials were presented in the same block, as a standard baseline task. in experiment 2, a second group completed the separated task, in which reward and punishment trials were presented in separate blocks. additionally, in order to understand the mechanisms underlying performance in the experimental conditions, we fit individual data using a q-learning model. results from experiment 1 show that subjects who completed the intermixed task paradoxically valued the no-feedback outcome as a reinforcer when it occurred on reinforcement-based trials, and as a punisher when it occurred on punishment-based trials. this is supported by patterns of empirical responding, where subjects showed more win-stay behavior following an explicit reward than following an omission of punishment, and more lose-shift behavior following an explicit punisher than following an omission of reward. in experiment 2, results showed similar performance whether subjects received reward-based or punishment-based trials first. however, when the q-learning model was applied to these data, there were differences between subjects in the reward-first and punishment-first conditions on the relative weighting of neutral feedback. specifically, early training on reward-based trials led to omission of reward being treated as similar to punishment, but prior training on punishment-based trials led to omission of reward being treated more neutrally. this suggests that early training on one type of trials, specifically reward-based trials, can create a bias in how neutral feedback is processed, relative to those receiving early punishment-based training or training that mixes positive and negative outcomes.",10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00153,*Rewards; *Learning; *Punishment; Feedback,545,0,0.264523723,-2.607296494,0.154275093,-12.38388089,-0.265447282,-0.214410342

We compared model-derived measures of _-cell function between youth and adults with either impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes to determine if a _-cell defect differentiates these age groups.

Methods
This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Study. Youth (54 Y-IGT, 33 Y-D) and adults (250 A-IGT, 104 A-D) underwent 3-hour oral glucose tolerance tests for modeling of insulin secretion rates (ISRs), glucose sensitivity, and rate sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity was quantified as the glucose infusion rate/insulin (M/I) from a hyperglycemic clamp.

Results
Youth had lower insulin sensitivity despite similar body mass index. Analyses were adjusted for insulin sensitivity. Youth had higher basal ISRs (Y-IGT 200_ÃÂÃÂ±_161 vs A-IGT 152_ÃÂÃÂ±_74, P_<_.001; Y-D 245_ÃÂÃÂ±_2.5 vs A-D 168_ÃÂÃÂ±_115_pmol/min/m2, P = .007) and total ISRs (Y-IGT 124_ÃÂÃÂ±_86 vs A-IGT 98_ÃÂÃÂ±_39, P_<_.001; Y-D 116_ÃÂÃÂ±_110 vs A-D 97_ÃÂÃÂ±_62_nmol/m2, P = .002).

Conclusions
Model-derived measures of _-cell function provide additional insight into the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in youth with higher ISRs and _-cell secretion more responsive to glucose in youth relative to adults even after adjusting for differences in insulin sensitivity.

Polycystic ovary syndrome and metabolic syndrome.,,2006,"Hayden, Catherine; Balen, Adam",": there has been an upsurge in interest in polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) over the last 20-30 years, particularly since the revelation that insulin, by way of end-organ resistance and consequent hyperinsulinemia, has a significant role to play in its pathogenesis. dramatic changes in lifestyle have led to the current epidemic of obesity in both developed and some developing countries and there are many who believe that this lies at the heart of the rapid rise in the prevalence of pcos. this condition was previously considered relatively uncommon and predominantly the clinical realm of the gynecologist but it is now recognized as the most common endocrinopathy to affect women of reproductive age and has become a truly multidisciplinary concern owing to the potentially profound metabolic associations and implications for life-long health. there has been much speculation as to the outlook for women with pcos in mid- and later-life because many develop features that are consistent with metabolic syndrome (mbs). mbs, by definition, is a collection of features that are strongly associated with a risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. the inference is that there may be a substantial risk of increased morbidity and mortality for women with pcos that could be prevented or at least moderated many years earlier. this review initially addresses the prevalence of mbs in women with pcos and the current evidence as to the probable consequences of manifesting both conditions. the review then discusses current and potential therapeutic options for the different stages of a woman's life.,",10.1586/17474108.1.2.183,insulin resistance; metformin; metabolic syndrome; cardiovascular risk factors; hyperinsulinemia; polycystic ovary syndrome,1626,0,0.260609914,-2.612537554,0.115530303,-12.64553287,-0.177053184,-0.229228837

Spatial-topographic nestedness of interoceptive regions within the networks of decision making and emotion regulation: Combining ALE meta-analysis and MACM analysis.,,2022,"Tan, Yafei; Yan, Ranran; Gao, Yuan; Zhang, Meng; Northoff, Georg",": prominent theories propose that interoception modulates our behavioral and emotional responses involving decision-making and emotion regulation. are the regions implicated in interoception also spatially related to and possibly nested within the networks of decision making and emotion regulation? addressing this question, we performed three meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to identify the regions that are commonly activated by the three domains using activation likelihood estimation (ale). additionally, we assessed the coactivation pattern of identified common regions using meta-analytic connectivity modeling (macm). the results showed major overlaps of interoception with both decision making and emotion regulation in specifically the right dorsal anterior insula. the pairwise contrast analyses confirmed this finding and revealed conjunction-based activities in decision making and emotion regulation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dacc). macm based on the identified insula revealed a widespread convergent coactivation pattern with the left anterior insula, dacc, and bilateral thalamus which, together, constitute the salience network. among these co-activated regions, bilateral insula and the dacc were shared among all three domains. these results suggest that the regions mediating interoception including intero-exteroceptive integration and salience attribution are contained and thus spatially nested within the more extensive networks recruited during decision making and emotion regulation.,",10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119500,decision making; meta-analysis; emotion regulation; insula; Interoception; salience network,998,0,0.259834984,-2.639697886,0.092890995,-10.53223484,-0.474913393,-0.286262305
"Risk and Rationality in Adolescent Decision Making: Implications for Theory, Practice, and Public Policy.",,2006,"Reyna, Valerie F; Farley, Frank","crime, smoking, drug use, alcoholism, reckless driving, and many other unhealthy patterns of behavior that play out over a lifetime often debut during adolescence. avoiding risks or buying time can set a different lifetime pattern. changing unhealthy behaviors in adolescence would have a broad impact on society, reducing the burdens of disease, injury, human suffering, and associated economic costs. any program designed to prevent or change such risky behaviors should be founded on a clear idea of what is normative (what behaviors, ideally, should the program foster?), descriptive (how are adolescents making decisions in the absence of the program?), and prescriptive (which practices can realistically move adolescent decisions closer to the normative ideal?). normatively, decision processes should be evaluated for coherence (is the thinking process nonsensical, illogical, or self-contradictory?) and correspondence (are the outcomes of the decisions positive?). behaviors that promote positive physical and mental health outcomes in modern society can be at odds with those selected for by evolution (e.g., early procreation). healthy behaviors may also conflict with a decision maker's goals. adolescents' goals are more likely to maximize immediate pleasure, and strict decision analysis implies that many kinds of unhealthy behavior, such as drinking and drug use, could be deemed rational. however, based on data showing developmental changes in goals, it is important for policy to promote positive long-term outcomes rather than adolescents' short-term goals. developmental data also suggest that greater risk aversion is generally adaptive, and that decision processes that support this aversion are more advanced than those that support risk taking. a key question is whether adolescents are developmentally competent to make decisions about risks. in principle, barring temptations with high rewards and individual differences that reduce self-control (i.e., under ideal conditions), adolescents are capable of rational decision making to achieve their goals. in practice, much depends on the particular situation in which a decision is made. in the heat of passion, in the presence of peers, on the spur of the moment, in unfamiliar situations, when trading off risks and benefits favors bad long-term outcomes, and when behavioral inhibition is required for good outcomes, adolescents are likely to reason more poorly than adults do. brain maturation in adolescence is incomplete. impulsivity, sensation seeking, thrill seeking, depression, and other individual differences also contribute to risk taking that resists standard risk-reduction interventions, although some conditions such as depression can be effectively treated with other approaches. major explanatory models of risky decision making can be roughly divided into (a) those, including health-belief models and the theory of planned behavior, that adhere to a 'rational' behavioral decision-making framework that stresses deliberate, quantitative trading off of risks and benefits; and (b) those that emphasize nondeliberative reaction to the perceived gists or prototypes in the immediate decision environment. although perceived risks and especially benefits predict behavioral intentions and risk-taking behavior, behavioral willingness is an even better predictor of susceptibility to risk taking-and has unique explanatory power-because adolescents are willing to do riskier things than they either intend or expect to do. dual-process models, such as the prototype/willingness model and fuzzy-trace theory, identify two divergent paths to risk taking: a reasoned and a reactive route. such models explain apparent contradictions in the literature, including different causes of risk taking for different individuals. interventions to reduce risk taking must take into account the different causes of such behavior if they are to be effective.",10.1111/j.1529-1006.2006.00026.x,Intervention; Adolescent Development; Developmental Psychology; *Decision Making; *Risk Taking; Aversion; *Models; Health; *Adolescent Attitudes; *Government Policy Making; Social Issues,903,0,0.259541567,-2.572195689,0.111004785,-12.22649782,-0.224282988,-0.235051667
Adolescents Adapt More Slowly than Adults to Varying Reward Contingencies.,,2014,"Javadi, Amir Homayoun; Schmidt, Dirk H.

Error-related medial frontal theta activity predicts cingulate-related structural connectivity.,,2011,"Cohen, Michael","studies on electrophysiological signatures of error processing have focused on the medial frontal cortex, although widespread neuroanatomical networks support error/action monitoring. here, electrophysiological responses to errors were combined with structural white matter diffusion tensor imaging (dti) to investigate the long-range anatomical networks that support error processing. the approach taken here was to link individual differences in error-related eeg responses to individual differences in white matter connectional anatomy. twenty subjects performed a speeded instructed choice task (a variant of the simon task) designed to elicit response errors, and also underwent dti scanning in a separate session. in the eeg data, significantly enhanced theta (4-8 hz) oscillations were observed over medial frontal electrodes (centered on fcz) during response errors. mid-frontal scalp sites (likely reflecting medial frontal cortex activity) also functioned as a strong ""hub"" for information flow, measured through theta-band phase synchronization degree. next, a dipole source of the error-related theta-band activity was localized for each subject, accounting for approximately 80% of the topographical variance. correlating individual differences in medial frontal theta dynamics with white matter tracts linking these dipole sources to the rest of the brain revealed that subjects with stronger error-related theta also had stronger white matter connectivity with the ventral striatum and inferior frontal gyrus. further, subjects in whom medial frontal regions acted as a stronger synchronization ""hub"" had stronger connectivity between the dipole source location and the corpus callosum and dorsomedial prefrontal white matter pathways. these findings provide novel evidence for the role of widespread fronto-striatal networks in monitoring actions and signaling behavioral errors.,",10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.072,Connectivity; EEG; DTI; Theta; Diffusion imaging; ERN; Oscillation; Synchrony,1499,0,0.259308153,-2.62163644,0.174228675,-11.66152153,-0.330711592,-0.206246142

""pathological habit"" thus appears as a good candidate to explain the transition to compulsive drug use. however, drug use could also be considered as a goal-directed choice, driven by the expectation of drug outcomes. for example, drug addicts may engage in drug-seeking behaviors because they view the drug as more valuable than available alternatives. substance use disorders therefore may not be all about habit, nor fully intentional, and could be considered as resulting from an imbalance between goal-directed and habitual control. the main objective of this review is to disentangle the relative contribution of habit formation and impairment of goal-directed behavior in this unbalanced control of addictive behaviors. although deficits in goal-directed behavior have been demonstrated in alcohol and substance use disorders, reliable demonstration of abnormal habit formation has been curtailed by the paucity of paradigms designed to assess habit as a positive result. refining our animal and human model of habit is therefore required to precisely define the place of habit in substance use disorders and develop appropriate and adapted neurobehavioral treatments., highlights:, habits are generally defined as a stimulus-response association., habits are operationalized as an absence of goal-directed behavior., addictions result from an imbalance between goal-directed and habitual control., addictions are associated with deficits in goal-directed control., * whether abnormal habits contribute to addictive behavior remains an open question.,",10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.06.029,Learning; Addiction; Goal-directed; Drugs; Habit; Stimulus-response,1159,0,0.244701913,-2.595848796,0.136321195,-11.5707882,-0.269572812,-0.222848704

Neurocognitive Performance in Unmedicated Patients With Hoarding Disorder.,,2016,"Sumner, JM; Noack, CG; Filoteo, JV; Maddox, WT; Saxena, S","Hoarding disorder (HD) is an often incapacitating psychiatric illness associated with a wide range of neurocognitive abnormalities. Some prior neuropsychological studies have found executive dysfunction in HD, but no clear pattern has emerged. One potential reason for discrepant results in previous studies might be the inclusion of patients on psychotropic and other medications that can affect neurocognitive performance. Therefore, we examined neurocognitive functioning in medication-free HD patients. We also added a novel investigation of implicit learning, which has been found to be abnormal in obsessiveÃÂÃÂcompulsive disorder (OCD) and related disorders. Method: Twenty-six participants meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSMÃÂÃÂ5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) diagnostic criteria for HD and 23 normal controls were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests and symptom rating scales. All participants were free of psychotropic medications for at least 6 weeks prior to the study. Results: HD participants showed no significant differences from normal controls on measures of verbal memory, attention, or executive functioning, including response inhibition, planning, organization, and decision making. However, HD participants demonstrated a trend toward less implicit learning and greater use of explicit learning strategies during perceptual categorization compared to normal controls. HD participants who used an implicit strategy performed significantly worse than controls who used an implicit strategy. Hoarding symptom severity was not associated with neurocognitive performance. Conclusions: HD patients may have a tendency to use explicit rather than implicit learning strategies for perceptual categorization but perform as well as normal controls on many other neurocognitive measures.

"The orbitofrontal cortex and emotion in health and disease, including depression[white star].",,2019,"rolls, edmund; rolls, edmund t",": the orbitofrontal cortex represents the reward or affective value of primary reinforcers including taste, touch, texture, and face expression. it learns to associate other stimuli with these to produce representations of the expected reward value for visual, auditory, and abstract stimuli including monetary reward value. the orbitofrontal cortex thus plays a key role in emotion, by representing the reward value of the goals for action. the learning process is stimulus-reinforcer association learning. negative reward prediction error neurons are related to this affective learning. activations in the orbitofrontal cortex correlate with the subjective emotional experience of affective stimuli, and damage to the orbitofrontal cortex impairs emotion-related learning, emotional behaviour, and subjective affective state. top-down attention to affect modulates orbitofrontal cortex representations, and attention to intensity modulates representations in earlier cortical areas that represent the physical properties of stimuli. top-down word-level cognitive inputs can bias affective representations in the orbitofrontal cortex, providing a mechanism for cognition to influence emotion. whereas the orbitofrontal cortex provides a representation of reward or affective value on a continuous scale, areas beyond the orbitofrontal cortex such as the medial prefrontal cortex area 10 are involved in binary decision-making when a choice must be made. for this decision-making, the orbitofrontal cortex provides a representation of the value of each specific reward on the same scale, with no conversion to a common currency. increased activity in a lateral orbitofrontal cortex non-reward area provides a new attractor-related approach to understanding and treating depression. consistent with the theory, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex has increased functional connectivity in depression, and the medial orbitofrontal cortex, involved in reward, has decreased functional connectivity in depression., highlights:, the functions and disorders of function of the orbitofrontal cortex are described., the medial orbitofrontal cortex is involved in many specific types of reward., the lateral orbitofrontal cortex is involved in non-reward and punishers., these provide a basis for understanding emotion, and food reward., * these concepts are extended to non-reward attractor networks and depression.,",10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.09.021, *decision making;  *emotions;  *major depression;  *orbitofrontal cortex;  *rewards;  attention;  brain connectivity;  cingulate cortex;  cognition;  depression;  emotion;  hunger;  orbitofrontal cortex;  prefrontal cortex;  reward;  smell;  taste; decision-making; test construction,2916,0,0.243088322,-2.687987242,0.110694184,-12.46350557,-0.256532541,-0.259137589

Modes of cognition: Evidence from metastable brain dynamics.,,2022,"Capouskova, Katerina; Kringelbach, Morten; Deco, Gustavo",": managing cognitive load depends on adequate resource allocation by the human brain through the engagement of metastable substates, which are large-scale functional networks that change over time. we employed a novel analysis method, deep autoencoder dynamical analysis (dada), with 100 healthy adults selected from the human connectome project (hcp) data set in rest and six cognitive tasks. the deep autoencoder of dada described seven recurrent stochastic metastable substates from the functional connectome of bold phase coherence matrices. these substates were significantly differentiated in terms of their probability of appearance, time duration, and spatial attributes. we found that during different cognitive tasks, there was a higher probability of having more connected substates dominated by a high degree of connectivity in the thalamus. in addition, compared with those during tasks, resting brain dynamics have a lower level of predictability, indicating a more uniform distribution of metastability between substates, quantified by higher entropy. these novel findings provide empirical evidence for the philosophically motivated cognitive theory, suggesting on-line and off-line as two fundamentally distinct modes of cognition. on-line cognition refers to task-dependent engagement with the sensory input, while off-line cognition is a slower, environmentally detached mode engaged with decision and planning. overall, the dada framework provides a bridge between neuroscience and cognitive theory that can be further explored in the future., highlights:, deep autoencoder dynamical analysis (dada) identified metastable brain substates., more connected substates are found during tasks compared to rest., higher entropy was found for resting brain dynamics compare to task., the results support on-line and off-line as two distinct modes of cognition., * dada provides a potential bridge between neuroscience and cognitive theory.,",10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119489,fMRI; Functional connectivity; Entropy; Brain states; Classification; DADA; HCP data set,999,0,0.24205625,-2.609722005,0.148423006,-13.04199679,-0.175457352,-0.215082673
Uncertainty-driven regulation of learning and exploration in adolescents: A computational account.,,2020,"Jepma, Marieke; Schaaf, Jessica V.; Visser, Ingmar; Huizenga, Hilde M.","healthy adults flexibly adapt their learning strategies to ongoing changes in uncertainty, a key feature of adaptive behaviour. however, the developmental trajectory of this ability is yet unknown, as developmental studies have not incorporated trial-to-trial variation in uncertainty in their analyses or models. to address this issue, we compared adolescents' and adults' trial-to-trial dynamics of uncertainty, learning rate, and exploration in two tasks that assess learning in noisy but otherwise stable environments. in an estimation taskÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwhich provides direct indices of trial-specific learning rateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂboth age groups reduced their learning rate over time, as self-reported uncertainty decreased. accordingly, the estimation data in both groups was better explained by a bayesian model with dynamic learning rate (kalman filter) than by conventional reinforcement-learning models. furthermore, adolescents' learning rates asymptoted at a higher level, reflecting an over-weighting of the most recent outcome, and the estimated kalman-filter parameters suggested that this was due to an overestimation of environmental volatility. in a choice task, both age groups became more likely to choose the higher-valued option over time, but this increase in choice accuracy was smaller in the adolescents. in contrast to the estimation task, we found no evidence for a bayesian expectation-updating process in the choice task, suggesting that estimation and choice tasks engage different learning processes. however, our modeling results of the choice task suggested that both age groups reduced their degree of exploration over time, and that the adolescents explored overall more than the adults. finally, age-related differences in exploration parameters from fits to the choice data were mediated by participants' volatility parameter from fits to the estimation data. together, these results suggest that adolescents overestimate the rate of environmental change, resulting in elevated learning rates and increased exploration, which may help understand developmental changes in learning and decision-making. author to successfully learn the value of stimuli and actions, people should take into account their current (un)certainty about these values: learning rates and exploration should be high when one's value estimates are highly uncertain (in the beginning of learning), and decrease over time as evidence accumulates and uncertainty decreases. recent studies have shown that healthy adults flexibly adapt their learning strategies based on ongoing changes in uncertainty, consistent with normative learning. however, the development of this ability prior to adulthood is yet unknown, as developmental learning studies have not considered trial-to-trial changes in uncertainty. here, we show that adolescents, as compared to adults, showed a smaller decrease in both learning rate and exploration over time. computational modeling revealed that both of these effects were due to adolescents overestimating the amount of environmental volatility, which made them more sensitive to recent relative to older evidence. the overestimation of volatility during adolescence may represent the rapidly changing environmental demands during this developmental period, and can help understand the surge in real-life risk taking and exploratory behaviours characteristic of adolescents.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008276,TEENAGERS; ADOLESCENCE; AGE groups; KALMAN filtering; LEARNING strategies,1925,0,0.24198272,-2.574624469,0.103448276,-12.61904009,-0.236702584,-0.255070038

(b) providing the cognitive architecture with more representation of the body. in our example, we provide a physiological substrate to implement behavioral moderators' effects on cognition. cognitive architectures can now be broader in the measurements they predict and correspond to. this approach provides a more complete and theoretically appropriate way to include new aspects of behavior including stressor effects and emotions in models. and (c) using machine learning techniques, particularly genetic algorithms (gas), to fit models to data. because of the model complexity, this is equivalent to performing a multi-variable non-linear stochastic multiple-output regression. doing this by hand is completely inadequate. while there is a danger of overfitting using a ga, these fits can help provide a better understanding of the model and architecture, including how the architecture changes under moderators such stress. this paper also includes some notes on model maintenance and reporting.",10.1007/s10588-020-09308-7,Emotions; Human behavior models; ACT-R; America; Architectural design; Cognitive architecture; Data modeling; Genetic algorithm; Genetic algorithms; Interaction; Model fit; Model optimization; Moderators; Pattern matching; User models; Vision models,1927,0,0.240224761,-2.608850235,0.129213483,-13.11060699,-0.183186703,-0.233072503

Systematic parameter reviews in cognitive modeling: Towards a robust and cumulative characterization of psychological processes in the diffusion decision model.,,2021,"Tran, N. -Han; van Maanen, Leendert; Heathcote, Andrew; Matzke, Dora","parametric cognitive models are increasingly popular tools for analyzing data obtained from psychological experiments. one of the main goals of such models is to formalize psychological theories using parameters that represent distinct psychological processes. we argue that systematic quantitative reviews of parameter estimates can make an important contribution to robust and cumulative cognitive modeling. parameter reviews can benefit model development and model assessment by providing valuable information about the expected parameter space, and can facilitate the more efficient design of experiments. importantly, parameter reviews provide crucial-if not indispensable-information for the specification of informative prior distributions in bayesian cognitive modeling. from the bayesian perspective, prior distributions are an integral part of a model, reflecting cumulative theoretical knowledge about plausible values of the model's parameters (lee, 2018). in this paper we illustrate how systematic parameter reviews can be implemented to generate informed prior distributions for the diffusion decision model (ddm; ratcliff and mckoon, 2008), the most widely used model of speeded decision making. we surveyed the published literature on empirical applications of the ddm, extracted the reported parameter estimates, and synthesized this information in the form of prior distributions. our parameter review establishes a comprehensive reference resource for plausible ddm parameter values in various experimental paradigms that can guide future applications of the model. based on the challenges we faced during the parameter review, we formulate a set of general and ddm-specific suggestions aiming to increase reproducibility and the information gained from the review process.",10.3389/fpsyg.2020.608287,Psychodynamics; *Decision Making; *Cognitive Processes; *Models; *Cognitive Science; *Statistical Sample Parameters,194,0,0.239087799,-2.627099661,0.12593985,-11.45106452,-0.254773444,-0.229574277

ADHD as a model of brain-behavior relationships.,,2013,"Koziol, Leonard F; Budding, Deborah Ely; Chidekel, Dana","this paper replaces a localizationist view of cognitive, affective, motivational, executive, and sensorimotor functioning with a view that highlights connections among the neocortex, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, and their interaction within the context of large-scale brain networks and systems that define the brain's ""vertical"" organization. we use the behaviors or ""symptoms"" associated with adhd to illustrate brain-behavior relationships within this interactive context. we emphasize a need to refine the current methods by which adhd is defined and symptoms are measured. this paper highlights the inadequacy of current dsm behavioral criteria given their faulty foundational assumption that adhd is a unitary disorder, inability to account for the heterogeneity of symptom presentations, and their associated frequent overlap with other diagnostic conditions. we additionally underscore the limitations of current neuropsychological nomenclature in diagnosis and treatment given its focus on individual symptoms and inability to encompass the groups of heterogeneous symptoms that characterize adhd in its various presentations. we propose synthesizing the diffuse behavioral criteria for adhd into foundational, measurable components and integrating these with an understanding of large-scale brain network models and patterns of intrinsic and functional connectivity. we propose replacing current models of adhd with research domain criteria (""rdoc""), which places the consideration of disorders on a continuum by examining individual symptoms within a similar framework. we discuss the manner in which connections are made among the frontoparietal network, the dorsal and ventral attentional networks, the visual network, the limbic network, the sensorimotor network, and the default network. we discuss the relationship of their function to symptoms of adhd, and consider how their development might explain how symptoms of adhd emerge and evolve over time. rdoc is proposed as a means to define and differentiate brain-behavior relationships within an interactive context. it allows individual symptoms within a similar framework to be examined by focusing on the fundamental mechanisms of neurobehavioral pathology that drive them so the function of specific brain networks that contribute to different symptomatic profiles of adhd can be understood, as readily as can those that contribute to nonpathological behavior. defining the foundational constructs allows behaviors that are not specified within behavioral criteria for a disorder, but which nevertheless create problems, to be considered and addressed. false-negative conclusions can be avoided. using this model will drive the development of more effective symptomatic treatments for all mental disorders, and will inform the development of treatments that can be optimally matched. new neuropsychological tests will be developed that allow critical, foundational components of behavior to be measured. the current-and often deceptive-practice of scaling test findings will be supplanted with an emphasis on pattern analysis and a consideration of pathognomonic signs. in these ways, the rdoc model promises to increase the reliability and clinical utility of neuropsychology by providing the field a more specific approach to diagnosis and treatment.",10.1007/978-1-4614-8382-3,*Biological Neural Networks; *Cerebellum; *Cognitive Ability; *Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Symptoms; *Basal Ganglia; Brain Development,666,0,0.229788571,-2.649126281,0.122905028,-11.90509026,-0.279617264,-0.248575545

Anhedonia in schizophrenia: A deficit in translating reward information into motivated behavior.,,2014,"Strauss, Gregory P","anhedonia has long been considered a core clinical feature of schizophrenia, which is thought to be an important predictor of functional outcome and disease liability. however, recent developments in the affective neuroscience of schizophrenia suggest that the traditional understanding of anhedonia as a diminished capacity for pleasure may not correctly characterize the affective abnormalities that occur in this patient population. in the current chapter, literature is reviewed to suggest that anhedonia in schizophrenia primarily reflects a deficit in initiating activities aimed at receiving rewards, rather than a reduced capacity to experience pleasure when patients are exposed to rewards. multiple psychological and neural mechanisms appear to impair the translation of intact hedonic responses into goal directed behavior in schizophrenia. several of these mechanisms are reviewed here, including: (1) dopamine-mediated basal ganglia systems that support reinforcement learning and the ability to predict cues that lead to rewarding outcomes; (2) orbitofrontal cortex-driven deficits in generating, updating, and maintaining value representations; (3) aberrant effort-value computations, which may be mediated by disrupted anterior cingulate cortex and midbrain dopamine functioning; (4) altered activation of the prefrontal cortex, which is important for generating exploratory behaviors in environments where reward outcomes are uncertain; overall, findings suggest that aberrant cortical-striatal interactions are involved with the reduced frequency of pleasurable activities that characterizes schizophrenia. suggestions are provided for the development of novel behavioral intervention strategies that make use of external cues and reinforcers designed to facilitate goal-directed behavior in light of these various reward-processing deficits. future directions for examining anhedonia in relation to modem affective neuroscience perspectives are also discussed.",10.1007/978-94-017-8610-2_5,*Rewards; *Motivation; *Schizophrenia; *Anhedonia,612,0,0.226979232,-2.651138465,0.140350877,-11.38015632,-0.481305393,-0.274801264

"Searching for the Best Cause: Roles of Mechanism Beliefs, Autocorrelation, and Exploitation.",,2016,"Rottman, BM","When testing which of multiple causes (e.g., medicines) works best, the testing sequence has important implications for the validity of the final judgment. Trying each cause for a period of time before switching to the other is important if the causes have tolerance, sensitization, delay, or carryover (TSDC) effects. In contrast, if the outcome variable is autocorrelated and gradually fluctuates over time rather than being random across time, it can be useful to quickly alternate between the 2 causes, otherwise the causes could be confounded with a secular trend in the outcome. Five experiments tested whether individuals modify their causal testing strategies based on beliefs about TSDC effects and autocorrelation in the outcome. Participants adaptively tested each cause for longer periods of time before switching when testing causal interventions for which TSDC effects were plausible relative to cases when TSDC effects were not plausible. When the autocorrelation in the baseline trend was manipulated, participants exhibited only a small (if any) tendency toward increasing the amount of alternation; however, they adapted to the autocorrelation by focusing on changes in outcomes rather than raw outcome scores, both when making choices about which cause to test as well as when making the final judgment of which cause worked best.

Decomposing the roles of perseveration and expected value representation in models of the Iowa Gambling Task.,,2013,"Worthy, Darrell A; Pang, Bo; Byrne, Kaileigh A","models of human behavior in the iowa gambling task (igt) have played a pivotal role in accounting for behavioral differences during decision-making. one critical difference between models that have been used to account for behavior in the igt is the inclusion or exclusion of the assumption that participants tend to persevere, or stay with the same option over consecutive trials. models that allow for this assumption include win-stay-lose-shift (wsls) models and reinforcement learning (rl) models that include a decay learning rule where expected values for each option decay as they are chosen less often. one shortcoming of rl models that have included decay rules is that the tendency to persevere by sticking with the same option has been conflated with the tendency to select the option with the highest expected value because a single term is used to represent both of these tendencies. in the current work we isolate the tendencies to perseverate and to select the option with the highest expected value by including them as separate terms in a value-plus-perseveration (vpp) rl model. overall the vpp model provides a better fit to data from a large group of participants than models that include a single term to account for both perseveration and the representation of expected value. simulations of each model show that the vpp model's simulated choices most closely resemble the decision-making behavior of human subjects. in addition, we also find that parameter estimates of loss aversion are more strongly correlated with performance when perseverative tendencies and expected value representations are decomposed as separate terms within the model. the results suggest that the tendency to persevere and the tendency to select the option that leads to the best net payoff are central components of decision-making behavior in the igt. future work should use this model to better examine decision-making behavior.",10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00640,Models; Expectations; *Gambling; *Decision Making; *Perseveration,679,0,0.218863091,-2.67042501,0.137418756,-11.6159883,-0.32193447,-0.247864302

Action-outcome learning in the pathophysiology of addiction
The traditional paradigms to investigate action-outcome associations in addiction have been the probabilistic reversal learning task, in which individuals must learn the value of a stimulus through trial-and-error, and the bandit task, in which participants sample from different choice options (bandits) that have unknown probabilities of winning and losing. More recently, innovative tasks have been developed to simultaneously characterise multiple learning strategies within the same individual

Leveraging new models of action-outcome learning to inform treatment and recovery

On the irrationality of emotion and the rationality of awareness.,,2008,"Lambie, John A","it is argued that one answer to the question of the rationality of emotion hinges on the different roles in action selection played by emotions when one is aware of them versus when one is not aware of them (awareness being indexed by the ability to report one's emotion). when unaware of one's emotions, they are: (a) not able to enter into one's deliberations about what to do, and (b) more likely to be automatically acted out. this is a problem for rationality because (partly due to the logic of signal detection theory) emotional action urges are often ""false positives"". in contrast, awareness of emotions crucially allows emotional responses to be inhibited: such inhibition is necessary for truly rational action selection. furthermore, awareness enables reflective revision--the modification of one's theories and action plans as a result of awareness of inconsistencies between theories and data, and action plans and goals.",10.1016/j.concog.2007.03.005,*Emotions; *Awareness; *Rationality,867,0,0.216978503,-2.623071247,0.11047619,-12.46603696,-0.249087702,-0.261500896

The somatic marker hypothesis and its neural basis: Using past experiences to forecast the future in decision making.,,2011,"Bechara, Antoine","we have proposed a neural framework for how some of the factors affecting decision-making may be implemented in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmpfc). the major advancement in the size, complexity, and connectivity of the frontal lobes in humans has occurred in relation to brodmann area (ba) 10, i.e., the frontal pole, and not so much to the more posterior areas of the vmpfc. we have proposed that information conveying delay in the future (or distance in the past) depends on the integrity of more anterior vmpfc cortices (i.e., frontal pole) in order for a delayed outcome to exert an influence on behavior. if those anterior regions (frontal pole) are damaged, decision-making shifts towards shorter time horizons (i.e., the decision-making process becomes more influenced by more immediate, or more recent, outcomes). as the damage extends to the more posterior vmpfc regions (including the anterior cingulate cortex, basal forebrain, and nucleus accumbens), the shortening of this time horizon (or high recency) becomes more severe. anatomically, the more posterior areas of the vmpfc (e.g., ba 25) are directly connected to brain structures involved in triggering (autonomic, neurotransmitter nuclei), or representing (sensory nuclei in the brainstem, insular, and somatosensory cortices) affective states, while access of more anterior areas is polysynaptic and indirect. it follows that coupling of information to representations of somatic states via posterior vmpfc is associated with relatively fast, effortless, and strong somatic signals, while the signallng via more anterior vmpfc is relatively slowed, effortful, and weak. consistent with this framework, we suggested that humans have developed greater capacity to decide according to outcomes that are far more distant in the future (or past). this capacity places even normal individuals at a disadvantage because nearer events possess stronger somatic states, so that they tend to bias decisions in their favor. however, damage to the vmpfc tends to curb this capacity to a much greater extent.",10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195395518.003.0048,Frontal Lobe; *Decision Making; *Neuropsychology; *Prefrontal Cortex; *Future; Time,777,0,0.214611447,-2.677340725,0.117757009,-11.88195674,-0.260255891,-0.254464852

The role of expecting feedback during decision-making under risk.,,2019,"Rigoli, Francesco; Martinelli, Cristina; Shergill, Sukhwinder",": sometimes choice is followed by outcome feedback and other times it is not. it remains unknown whether humans prefer gambling when they expect feedback to be revealed. regarding this question, decision-making theories make alternative predictions. some theories have proposed that choice is influenced by whether one expects to be disappointed in the future. given that feedback is sometimes disappointing, these theories predict increased aversion towards gambling when feedback is expected compared to when feedback is not expected. the opposite effect is predicted by theories of curiosity, which postulate reduction of uncertainty as an important behavioural drive. given that feedback reduces uncertainty, these theories predict that gambling will be favoured when feedback is expected. to examine whether expecting feedback influences gambling behaviour, we recorded functional neuroimaging data while participants performed a novel decision-making task requiring to chose between a sure option and a gamble. crucially, participants expected to receive feedback in some trials but not in other trials. consistent with theories of curiosity, we found that expecting feedback increased gambling propensity. at the neural level, at option presentation the increased value of gambling during feedback was reflected in activity in the ventral striatum. this suggests that, together with its established role in signalling reward, the ventral striatum also processes a form of epistemic value. our study demonstrates that gambling becomes more attractive when feedback is expected and suggests that striatal activity could signal the value of feedback information.,",10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116079,,1119,0,0.209576337,-2.641195368,0.164684355,-11.68499023,-0.304083711,-0.224856718

Effects of pramipexole on the processing of rewarding and aversive taste stimuli.,,2013,"McCabe, Ciara; Harwood, James; Brouwer, Sietske; Harmer, Catherine; Cowen, Philip","pramipexole, a d/d dopamine receptor agonist, has been implicated in the development of impulse control disorders in patients with parkinson's disease. investigation of single doses of pramipexole in healthy participants in reward-based learning tasks has shown inhibition of the neural processing of reward, presumptively through stimulation of dopamine autoreceptors. this study aims to examine the effects of pramipexole on the neural response to the passive receipt of rewarding and aversive sight and taste stimuli. we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural responses to the sight and taste of pleasant (chocolate) and aversive (mouldy strawberry) stimuli in 16 healthy volunteers who received a single dose of pramipexole (0.25 mg) and placebo in a double-blind, within-subject, design. relative to placebo, pramipexole treatment reduced blood oxygen level-dependent activation to the chocolate stimuli in the areas known to play a key role in reward, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, thalamus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. pramipexole also reduced activation to the aversive condition in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. there were no effects of pramipexole on the subjective ratings of the stimuli. our results are consistent with an ability of acute, low-dose pramipexole to diminish dopamine-mediated responses to both rewarding and aversive taste stimuli, perhaps through an inhibitory action of d autoreceptors on phasic burst activity of midbrain dopamine neurones. the ability of pramipexole to inhibit aversive processing might potentiate its adverse behavioural effects and could also play a role in its proposed efficacy in treatment-resistant depression.",10.1007/s00213-013-3033-9,fMRI; Depression; Reward; Aversion; Parkinson's disease; PARKINSON'S disease; IMPULSE control disorders; DOPAMINE receptors; AVERSIVE stimuli; Dopamine agonists; DRUG efficacy; Impulse disorders; PRAMIPEXOLE; TASTE perception,2176,0,0.205889883,-2.644985332,0.113636364,-12.8542836,-0.23405776,-0.266243408
Sequential delay and probability discounting tasks in mice reveal anchoring effects partially attributable to decision noise.,,2022,"Rojas, Gerardo; Curry-Pochy, Lisa; Chen, Cathy; Heller, Abigail; Grissom, Nicola","delay discounting and probability discounting decision making tasks in rodent models have high translational potential. however, it is unclear whether the discounted value of the large reward option is the main contributor to variability in animals' choices in either task, which may limit translation to humans. male and female mice underwent sessions of delay and probability discounting in sequence to assess how choice behavior adapts over experience with each task. to control for ""anchoring"" (persistent choices based on the initial delay or probability), mice experienced ""worsening"" schedules where the large reward was offered under initially favorable conditions that became less favorable during testing, followed by ""improving"" schedules where the large reward was offered under initially unfavorable conditions that improved over a session. during delay discounting, both male and female mice showed elimination of anchoring effects over training. in probability discounting, both sexes of mice continued to show some anchoring even after months of training. one possibility is that ""noisy"", exploratory choices could contribute to these persistent anchoring effects, rather than constant fluctuations in value discounting. we fit choice behavior in individual animals using models that included both a value-based discounting parameter and a decision noise parameter that captured variability in choices deviating from value maximization. changes in anchoring behavior over time were tracked by changes in both the value and decision noise parameters in delay discounting, but by the decision noise parameter in probability discounting. exploratory decision making was also reflected in choice response times that tracked the degree of conflict caused by both uncertainty and temporal cost, but was not linked with differences in locomotor activity reflecting chamber exploration. thus, variable discounting behavior in mice can result from changes in exploration of the decision options rather than changes in reward valuation.,",10.1016/j.bbr.2022.113951,Modeling; Mice; Delay discounting; Probability discounting; Touchscreen,1008,0,0.205776686,-2.519983166,0.089407191,-11.78024771,-0.275058913,-0.270230309
The roles of dopamine and serotonin in decision making: Evidence from pharmacological experiments in humans.,,2011,"Rogers, Robert D","neurophysiological experiments in primates, alongside neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance investigations in humans, have significantly enhanced our understanding of the neural architecture of decision making. in this review, i consider the more limited database of experiments that have investigated how dopamine and serotonin activity influences the choices of human adults. these include those experiments that have involved the administration of drugs to healthy controls, experiments that have tested genotypic influences upon dopamine and serotonin function, and, finally, some of those experiments that have examined the effects of drugs on the decision making of clinical samples. pharmacological experiments in humans are few in number and face considerable methodological challenges in terms of drug specificity, uncertainties about pre- vs post-synaptic modes of action, and interactions with baseline cognitive performance. however, the available data are broadly consistent with current computational models of dopamine function in decision making and highlight the dissociable roles of dopamine receptor systems in the learning about outcomes that underpins value-based decision making. moreover, genotypic influences on (interacting) prefrontal and striatal dopamine activity are associated with changes in choice behavior that might be relevant to understanding exploratory behaviors and vulnerability to addictive disorders. manipulations of serotonin in laboratory tests of decision making in human participants have provided less consistent results, but the information gathered to date indicates a role for serotonin in learning about bad decision outcomes, non-normative aspects of risk-seeking behavior, and social choices involving affiliation and notions of fairness. finally, i suggest that the role played by serotonin in the regulation of cognitive biases, and representation of context in learning, point toward a role in the cortically mediated cognitive appraisal of reinforcers when selecting between actions, potentially accounting for its influence upon the processing salient aversive outcomes and social choice.",10.1038/npp.2010.165,*Dopamine; *Decision Making; *Cognitive Ability; *Pharmacology; *Serotonin,775,0,0.205759493,-2.627065055,0.111742424,-11.24432767,-0.406417244,-0.282693714

Examining the effect of depressive symptoms on habit formation and habit-breaking.,,2021,"Byrne, Kaileigh A; Six, Stephanie G; Willis, Hunter C","dysfunction in reward processing is a hallmark feature of depression. in the context of reinforcement learning, previous research has linked depression with reliance on simple habit-driven ('model-free') learning strategies over more complex, goal-directed ('model-based') strategies. however, the relationship between depression and habit-breaking remains an under-explored research area. the current study sought to bridge this gap by investigating the effect of depressive symptoms on habit formation and habit-breaking under monetary and social feedback conditions. additionally, we examined whether spontaneous eyeblink rate (ebr), an indirect marker for striatal dopamine levels, would modulate such effects. depressive symptoms were operationalized using self-report measures. to examine differences in habit formation and habit breaking, undergraduate participants (n = 156) completed a two-stage reinforcement learning task with a devaluation procedure using either monetary or social feedback. regression results showed that in the monetary feedback condition, spontaneous ebr moderated the relationship between depressive symptoms and model-free strategies; individuals with more depressive symptomatology and high ebr (higher dopamine levels) exhibited increased reliance on model-free strategies. depressive symptoms negatively predicted devaluation sensitivity, indicative of difficulty in habit-breaking, in both monetary and social feedback contexts. limitations: social feedback relied on fixed feedback rather than real-time peer evaluations; depressive symptoms were measured using self-report rather than diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder; dopaminergic functioning was measured using ebr rather than pet imaging; potential confounds were not controlled for. these findings have implications for identifying altered patterns of habit formation and deficits in habit-breaking among those experiencing depressive symptoms.",10.1016/j.jbtep.2021.101676,*Major Depression; *Reward Learning; *Habits; *Psychiatric Symptoms,202,0,0.204838285,-2.723373096,0.134314627,-11.30810767,-0.38576162,-0.26841744

Emotion and the Prefrontal Cortex: An Integrative Review.,,2017,"Dixon, ML; Thiruchselvam, R; Todd, R; Christoff, K","The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in the generation and regulation of emotion. However, we lack an integrative framework for understanding how different emotion-related functions are organized across the entire expanse of the PFC, as prior reviews have generally focused on specific emotional processes (e.g., decision making) or specific anatomical regions (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex). Additionally, psychological theories and neuroscientific investigations have proceeded largely independently because of the lack of a common framework. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological, lesion, and structural connectivity studies on the emotion-related functions of 8 subregions spanning the entire PFC. We introduce the appraisal-by-content model, which provides a new framework for integrating the diverse range of empirical findings. Within this framework, appraisal serves as a unifying principle for understanding the PFCÃÂÃÂs role in emotion, while relative content-specialization serves as a differentiating principle for understanding the role of each subregion. A synthesis of data from affective, social, and cognitive neuroscience studies suggests that different PFC subregions are preferentially involved in assigning value to specific types of inputs: exteroceptive sensations, episodic memories and imagined future events, viscero-sensory signals, viscero-motor signals, actions, othersÃÂÃÂ mental states (e.g., intentions), self-related information, and ongoing emotions. We discuss the implications of this integrative framework for understanding emotion regulation, value-based decision making, emotional salience, and refining theoretical models of emotion.

Debiasing of Gambling Beliefs and Behaviors Using a Digital Gambling Accelerator.,,2019,"Broussard, J; Wulfert, E","Problem gamblers tend to adhere to rigid rules about the chances of winning and are resistant to counterfactual information. To promote a more accurate understanding of the odds of scratch-off ticket gambling, we created a brief debiasing intervention consisting of a digital gambling accelerator program that offers demonstrations of the long-term outcomes of gambling. Using a sample of nontreatment seeking scratch-off lottery gamblers recruited from the community (42 subclinical and 45 probable pathological gamblers), we compared the accelerator intervention to brief motivational interviewing (MI) and a control condition. Participants rated their chances of winning, urge to gamble, and readiness to change before and after the interventions. Self-reported dollar amount spent on scratch-off tickets and number of days gambled were assessed at baseline and again at 2- and 4-week follow-ups. Following the active interventions, gamblers in both conditions reported greater readiness to change than controls, and those in the accelerator condition also gave lower ratings of their chances of winning and urge to gamble. Marginal models showed participants in the accelerator condition gambled fewer days at the 2-week follow-up and spent less money at both the 2- and 4-week follow-ups compared to controls; no other between-subjects differences achieved statistical significance.

However, few studies have examined the neural basis of this impairment, particularly in adolescents with GAD. The goal of the current study was to address this gap in the literature.

Method
The study involved 51 adolescents with GAD and 51 typically developing (TD) comparison individuals matched on age (16.10 and 15.75 respective means), gender (30_F/21_M and 24_F/27_M), and IQ (103.20 and 103.18 respective means). Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a passive avoidance task.

Results
We found a significant Group-by-Reinforcement interaction within reward-related brain regions including the caudate, putamen, mid cingulate/paracentral lobule, and superior and middle frontal gyrus. TD adolescents showed a greater differential response to reward versus punishment feedback within these regions relative to adolescents with GAD. In particular, this reflected reduced responses to rewards in the adolescents with GAD. There were no group differences in neural responses when making approach/avoidance responses.

The results of this study suggest reduced differential responsiveness to reinforcement as a component of the pathophysiology seen in adolescents with GAD.

The Pathogenesis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): The Hypothesis of PCOS as Functional Ovarian Hyperandrogenism Revisited.,,2016,"Rosenfield, Robert; Ehrmann, David","polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) was hypothesized to result from functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (foh) due to dysregulation of androgen secretion in 1989-1995. subsequent studies have supported and amplified this hypothesis. when defined as otherwise unexplained hyperandrogenic oligoanovulation, two-thirds of pcos cases have functionally typical foh, characterized by 17-hydroxyprogesterone hyperresponsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation. two-thirds of the remaining pcos have foh detectable by testosterone elevation after suppression of adrenal androgen production. about 3% of pcos have a related isolated functional adrenal hyperandrogenism. the remaining pcos cases are mild and lack evidence of steroid secretory abnormalities; most of these are obese, which we postulate to account for their atypical pcos. approximately half of normal women with polycystic ovarian morphology (pcom) have subclinical foh-related steroidogenic defects. theca cells from polycystic ovaries of classic pcos patients in long-term culture have an intrinsic steroidogenic dysregulation that can account for the steroidogenic abnormalities typical of foh. these cells overexpress most steroidogenic enzymes, particularly cytochrome p450c17. overexpression of a protein identified by genome-wide association screening, differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic development 1a.v2, in normal theca cells has reproduced this pcos phenotype in vitro. a metabolic syndrome of obesity-related and/or intrinsic insulin resistance occurs in about half of pcos patients, and the compensatory hyperinsulinism has tissue-selective effects, which include aggravation of hyperandrogenism. pcos seems to arise as a complex trait that results from the interaction of diverse genetic and environmental factors. heritable factors include pcom, hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance, and insulin secretory defects. environmental factors include prenatal androgen exposure and poor fetal growth, whereas acquired obesity is a major postnatal factor. the variety of pathways involved and lack of a common thread attests to the multifactorial nature and heterogeneity of the syndrome. further research into the fundamental basis of the disorder will be necessary to optimally correct androgen levels, ovulation, and metabolic homeostasis.,",10.1210/er.2015-1104,,1269,0,0.181439399,-2.629535457,0.101048618,-12.96029725,-0.196915552,-0.275604235

Treating insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes with metformin and thiazolidinediones.,,2005,"Bailey, C.","insulin resistance underlies the pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular disease in most people with type 2 diabetes. metformin and thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) counter insulin resistance by different cellular mechanisms and with complementary effects, making them suited for use in combination. metformin exerts a stronger suppression of hepatic glucose output, while thiazolidinediones produce a greater increase in peripheral glucose uptake, enabling metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations to improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes with additive efficacy. basal insulin concentrations are not raised by metformin or thiazolidinediones, so there is minimal risk of hypoglycaemia, and metformin can reduce the weight gain associated with thiazolidinediones. there are overlapping effects of metformin and thiazolidinediones against a range of athero-thrombotic factors and markers. these include decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, reduced platelet aggregation, reductions of several vascular adhesion molecules, and reduced markers of low-grade inflammation such as c-reactive protein. additionally, thiazolidinediones increase adiponectin and slightly reduce blood pressure. both metformin and thiazolidinediones can improve components of the lipid profile: thiazolidinediones consistently reduce free fatty acid concentrations and decrease the proportion of small dense low-density-lipoprotein, and pioglitazone also decreases triglycerides. during co-administration, metformin and thiazolidinediones do not interfere with each other's pharmacokinetics, and lower doses of the two agents together can achieve efficacy with fewer side effects. metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations require attention to the precautions for both agents, especially renal, cardiac and hepatic status. thus, metformin and thiazolidinediones can be used in combination to address the hyperglycaemia and vascular risk in type 2 diabetes,",10.1111/j.1463-1326.2005.00497.x,insulin resistance; type 2 diabetes; treatment; metformin; glycaemic control; pioglitazone; rosaglitazone; thiazoldinediones; vascular risk,1650,0,0.180518483,-2.59902985,0.151260504,-12.83010859,-0.27653346,-0.251714891

"Cognitive strategies regulate fictive, but not reward prediction error signals in a sequential investment task.",,2014,"Gu, Xiaosi; Kirk, Ulrich; Lohrenz, Terry; Montague, Read",": computational models of reward processing suggest that foregone or fictive outcomes serve as important information sources for learning and augment those generated by experienced rewards (e.g. reward prediction errors). an outstanding question is how these learning signals interact with top-down cognitive influences, such as cognitive reappraisal strategies. using a sequential investment task and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that the reappraisal strategy selectively attenuates the influence of fictive, but not reward prediction error signals on investment behavior; such behavioral effect is accompanied by changes in neural activity and connectivity in the anterior insular cortex, a brain region thought to integrate subjective feelings with high-order cognition. furthermore, individuals differ in the extent to which their behaviors are driven by fictive errors versus reward prediction errors, and the reappraisal strategy interacts with such individual differences; a finding also accompanied by distinct underlying neural mechanisms. these findings suggest that the variable interaction of cognitive strategies with two important classes of computational learning signals (fictive, reward prediction error) represent one contributing substrate for the variable capacity of individuals to control their behavior based on foregone rewards. these findings also expose important possibilities for understanding the lack of control in addiction based on possibly foregone rewarding outcomes. hum brain mapp 35:3738-3749, 2014.",10.1002/hbm.22433,fMRI; decision-making; emotion regulation; insula; fictive learning; reappraisal; reward prediction errors,1362,0,0.172242556,-2.711586998,0.133828996,-12.10829015,-0.278954532,-0.265426838

The neuroscience of suicidal behavior.,,2018,"van Heeringen, Kees","while suicide is commonly thought to be an understandable reaction to severe stress, it is actually an abnormal reaction to regular situations. something more than unbearable stress is needed to explain suicide, and neuroscience shows what this is, how it is caused and how it can be treated. the author describes findings from neuroscientific research on suicide, using various approaches from population genetics to brain imaging. this book consists of ten chapters. chapters one and two address the occurrence of suicidal behaviors and their risk factors, and provide a model of the interactions between these risk factors by describing the specific vulnerability to suicidal behavior and elucidating how specific stressors interact with this vulnerability to lead to self-destructive behaviors. chapter three describes the neuroscience approaches to the study of these vulnerability and stress-related factors. the following chapters elaborate on these approaches in much more detail by focusing on findings from molecular (chapter four), cognitive (chapter five), and systems (chapter six) neuroscientific studies of suicidal behavior. chapter seven takes a developmental perspective, and focuses on the devastating neurobiological consequences of traumatic events during childhood, such as sexual and physical abuse. a novel understanding of brain functioning in the form of the predictive coding model is explored in relation to suicidal behavior in chapter eight, showing that a surprisingly large proportion of neurobiological findings described in the previous chapters can be integrated in a fascinating computational model of suicidal behavior. chapter nine focuses on the implications of a neuroscientific approach for the prediction of suicidal behavior, while chapter ten focuses on the problems and opportunities in treating suicidal behavior from a neuroscientific point of view.",10.1017/9781316563205,Causality; Genetics; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Stress; At Risk Populations; *Suicide; Treatment; *Neurosciences; Early Experience; Predisposition; Suicide Prevention; Trauma,387,0,0.170575456,-2.520276336,0.081553398,-11.0265646,-0.391669252,-0.303188383

Effects of peer observation on risky decision-making in adolescence: A meta-analytic review.,,2022,"Powers, Katherine E; Schaefer, Lena; Figner, Bernd; Somerville, Leah H","real-world health and crime statistics indicate that adolescents are prone to engage in risks in the presence of peers. although this effect has been documented in several lab studies, existing evidence varies and the psychological mechanisms that give rise to peer observation-induced shifts in adolescent risky decision-making remain poorly understood. we conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to quantify the magnitude of the effect of direct peer observation on risky decision-making in adolescents. across 186 effect sizes, representing data from 53 distinct research reports and over 5,000 participants, we found evidence that during adolescence, observation by peers increases decisions to take risks relative to decisions made while unobserved, with a small mean effect size (hedges' g = 0.16). we also found high effect size heterogeneity (i2 = 82.63% and tau2 = 0.078), motivating analysis of moderation. we evaluated whether variables hypothesized by theory and prior research to amplify or reduce risk taking in the presence of peers systematically moderated the size of this effect, including factors related to the decision context, the peer context, and the experimental design. the overall effect was moderated by peers' expression of risk-seeking preferences, such that the effect of peer observation was only significant when peers were also expressing pro-risk attitudes. evidence for publication bias was not consistently observed. taken together, this work supports the notion that mere peer observation increases adolescent risky decision-making, but this effect is extremely small unless the peers are additionally expressing pro-risk preferences. moreover, this work provokes questions regarding whether the field's approach to studying peer influence is optimal at conceptual and practical levels, and whether it is maximally translatable to real-world contexts. we offer suggestions for future work that could lead to a clearer understanding of peer observation effects during adolescence.",10.1037/bul0000382,*Decision Making; *Risk Taking; *Adolescent Psychology; *Peer Evaluation; *Peers; Peer Pressure; Peer Relations; Preferences,141,0,0.169454981,-2.595049092,0.134215501,-13.4670841,-0.190956368,-0.257621402

Generalization of value in reinforcement learning by humans.,,2012,"Wimmer, Elliott; Daw, Nathaniel; Shohamy, Daphna","research in decision-making has focused on the role of dopamine and its striatal targets in guiding choices via learned stimulus-reward or stimulus-response associations, behavior that is well described by reinforcement learning theories. however, basic reinforcement learning is relatively limited in scope and does not explain how learning about stimulus regularities or relations may guide decision-making. a candidate mechanism for this type of learning comes from the domain of memory, which has highlighted a role for the hippocampus in learning of stimulus-stimulus relations, typically dissociated from the role of the striatum in stimulus-response learning. here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and computational model-based analyses to examine the joint contributions of these mechanisms to reinforcement learning. humans performed a reinforcement learning task with added relational structure, modeled after tasks used to isolate hippocampal contributions to memory. on each trial participants chose one of four options, but the reward probabilities for pairs of options were correlated across trials. this (uninstructed) relationship between pairs of options potentially enabled an observer to learn about option values based on experience with the other options and to generalize across them. we observed blood oxygen level-dependent (bold) activity related to learning in the striatum and also in the hippocampus. by comparing a basic reinforcement learning model to one augmented to allow feedback to generalize between correlated options, we tested whether choice behavior and bold activity were influenced by the opportunity to generalize across correlated options. although such generalization goes beyond standard computational accounts of reinforcement learning and striatal bold, both choices and striatal bold activity were better explained by the augmented model. consistent with the hypothesized role for the hippocampus in this generalization, functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and hippocampus was modulated, across participants, by the ability of the augmented model to capture participants' choice. our results thus point toward an interactive model in which striatal reinforcement learning systems may employ relational representations typically associated with the hippocampus.,",10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08017.x,computational model; reward; hippocampus; ventral striatum; memory,1446,0,0.168631789,-2.682369671,0.126629423,-11.22449635,-0.272912462,-0.255951201

Abnormal temporal difference reward-learning signals in major depression.,,2008,"Kumar, P.; Waiter, G.; Ahearn, T.; Milders, M.; Reid, I.; Steele, J.","anhedonia is a core symptom of major depressive disorder (mdd), long thought to be associated with reduced dopaminergic function. however, most antidepressants do not act directly on the dopamine system and all antidepressants have a delayed full therapeutic effect. recently, it has been proposed that antidepressants fail to alter dopamine function in antidepressant unresponsive mdd. there is compelling evidence that dopamine neurons code a specific phasic (short duration) reward-learning signal, described by temporal difference (td) theory. there is no current evidence for other neurons coding a td reward-learning signal, although such evidence may be found in time. the neuronal substrates of the td signal were not explored in this study. phasic signals are believed to have quite different properties to tonic (long duration) signals. no studies have investigated phasic reward-learning signals in mdd. therefore, adults with mdd receiving long-term antidepressant medication, and comparison controls both unmedicated and acutely medicated with the antidepressant citalopram, were scanned using fmri during a reward-learning task. three hypotheses were tested: first, patients with mdd have blunted td reward-learning signals; second, controls given an antidepressant acutely have blunted td reward-learning signals; third, the extent of alteration in td signals in major depression correlates with illness severity ratings. the results supported the hypotheses. patients with mdd had significantly reduced reward-learning signals in many non-brainstem regions: ventral striatum (vs), rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex (rc), midbrain and hippocampus. however, the td signal was increased in the brainstem of patients. as predicted, acute antidepressant administration to controls was associated with a blunted td signal, and the brainstem td signal was not increased by acute citalopram administration. in a number of regions, the magnitude of the abnormal signals in mdd correlated with illness severity ratings. the findings highlight the importance of phasic reward-learning signals, and are consistent with the hypothesis that antidepressants fail to normalize reward-learning function in antidepressant-unresponsive mdd. whilst there is evidence that some antidepressants acutely suppress dopamine function, the long-term action of virtually all antidepressants is enhanced dopamine agonist responsiveness. this distinction might help to elucidate the delayed action of antidepressants. finally, analogous to recent work in schizophrenia, the finding of abnormal phasic reward-learning signals in mdd implies that an integrated understanding of symptoms and treatment mechanisms is possible, spanning physiology, phenomenology and pharmacology.,",10.1093/brain/awn136,major depressive disorder; citalopram; reward-learning; temporal difference signals,1588,0,0.162490351,-2.618156309,0.158088235,-13.38221512,-0.17479863,-0.238185378
The role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in memory consolidation.,,2011,"Nieuwenhuis, Ingrid; Takashima, Atsuko",": ""system-level memory consolidation theory"" posits that the hippocampus initially links the neocortical representations, followed by a shift to a hippocampus-independent neocortical network. with consolidation, an increase in activity in the human subgenual ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmpfc) has repeatedly been shown. previously we and others have proposed that this area might link the neocortical representational areas in remote memory, similarly as has been proposed for the rodent anterior cingulate cortex (acc). here, we review literature involving the human vmpfc to investigate if the results in other cognitive domains are in line with this proposal. we have taken into account reports on patients with lesions in this area, findings in reward and valuation, fear extinction, and confabulation studies, and integrated these with findings in consolidation studies. we conclude: firstly, it is unlikely that the rodent acc is homolog to the human subgenual vmpfc. it is more likely that the rodent infralimbic cortex is, as proposed in the fear extinction literature. secondly, we propose that the function of the subgenual vmpfc is to integrate information which is represented in separate parts of the limbic system (the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the ventral striatum) and that the integrated representation in the subgenual vmpfc might subsequently be used to suppress irrelevant representations in the limbic system. with the progression of time, the importance of the integrated representation in the subgenual vmpfc increases, because it may replace some direct connectivity across the limbic areas which decays with time.,",10.1016/j.bbr.2010.12.009,Sleep; Limbic system; Reward; Fear conditioning; Confabulation; Infralimbic; Memory consolidation; vmPFC,1497,0,0.162378075,-2.560726091,0.098360656,-11.12111838,-0.317860036,-0.280129264

It is all relative: Contextual influences on boredom and neural correlates of regulatory processes.,,2021,"Perone, Sammy; Anderson, Alana J.; Weybright, Elizabeth H.","interest in the influences on and strategies to mitigate boredom has grown immensely. boredom emerges in contexts in which people have difficulty paying attention, such as underchallenging relative to optimally challenging conditions. the current study probed contextual influences on peoples' experience of boredom by manipulating the order with which people performed easy and optimally challenging conditions of a task (n = 113). we measured frontal alpha asymmetry (faa) and theta/beta as neural correlates of self_regulatory and attentional control processes, respectively. results showed self_reported boredom was higher in the easy condition when the optimal condition was completed before it. similarly, participant's faa shifted rightward from the first to the second task when the optimal condition was completed prior to the easy condition, indicating that self_regulatory processes were strongly engaged under these context_specific conditions. theta/beta was lower during the easy relative to the optimal condition, regardless of the task order, indicating that maintaining attention in the easy condition was more difficult. no relations between perceptions of the task and neural correlates were observed. exploratory analyses revealed higher levels of variability in faa and theta/beta were associated with less enjoyment and more boredom, respectively. we speculate these observations reflect the less consistent engagement of self_regulatory and attentional control and, in turn, might play a role in peoples' subjective experience. we discuss the implications of our findings for our understanding of influences on and strategies to mitigate boredom, as well as how attentional and self_regulatory processes operate under conditions boredom typically emerges. boredom emerges when individuals are unable to pay attention. our study shows that contextual influences play an important role in boredom. prior experience completing an optimally challenging task exacerbates the experience of boredom while completing an easy task. analysis of frontal alpha asymmetry suggests that these task conditions engage self_regulatory processes. this study advances our understanding of influences on boredom as well as frontal alpha asymmetry as an active regulatory process.",10.1111/psyp.13746,EEG; boredom; BOREDOM; frontal alpha asymmetry; theta/beta ratio,1899,0,0.162066023,-2.656815635,0.111111111,-12.40343212,-0.273191689,-0.285279364

Translating cognition from animals to humans.,,2011,"Keeler, J.; Robbins, T.",": many clinical disorders, whether neurological (e.g. alzheimer's disease) or neuropsychiatric (e.g. schizophrenia and depression), exhibit cognitive symptoms that require pharmacological treatment. cognition is multi-faceted and includes processes of perception, attention, working memory, long-term memory, executive function, language and social cognition. this article reviews how it is feasible to model many aspects of human cognition with the use of appropriate animal models and associated techniques, including the use of computer controlled tests (e.g. touch-screens), for optimising translation of experimental research to the clinic. when investigating clinical disorders, test batteries should aim to profile cognitive function in order to determine which aspects are impaired and which are preserved. in this review we have paid particular attention to the validation of translational methods; this may be done through the application of common theoretical principles, by comparing the effects of psychological manipulations and, wherever feasible, with the demonstration of homologous neural circuitry or equivalent pharmacological actions in the animal and human paradigms. of particular importance is the use of 'back-translation' to ensure that the animal model has validity, for example, in predicting the effects of therapeutic drugs already found in human studies. it is made clear that the choice of appropriate behavioral tests is an important element of animal models of neuropsychiatric or neurological disorder; however, of course it is also important to select appropriate manipulations, whether genetic, neurodevelopmental, neurotoxic, or pharmacological, for simulating the neural substrates relevant to the disorders that lead to predictable behavioral and cognitive impairments, for optimising the testing of candidate compounds.,",10.1016/j.bcp.2010.12.028,Cognition; Learning; Prefrontal cortex; Working memory; Model; Executive function; Cerebral cortex; Hippocampus; Attention; Long-term memory,1493,0,0.152535875,-2.632061679,0.121212121,-11.50878791,-0.348965626,-0.283292525

"Wanting, liking and welfare: The role of affective states in proximate control of behaviour in vertebrates.",,2017,"Gygax, Lorenz","animals choose a course of action countless times each day. to do so, they need to prioritise their behaviour within a set of alternative actions and decide which of these actions to perform at any one time and for how long, that is, determine when the behaviour has reached its desired effect. this process has classically been called the proximate behavioural control mechanism. several aspects contribute to this process: internal and external stimuli, the emotions that they elicit, motivation (wants), behavioural goals, valuation, decision-making and its modulation by mood, and the assessment of behavioural outcomes (liking). i will address all these aspects in the form of an integrated conceptual model. in the process of behavioural control, options need to be valued, and i will refer to evidence showing that an affective hedonic process in respect to (future) reward and punishment heavily affects this value. moreover, i view motivation, the force that finally drives a specific behavioural output, as being primarily influenced by affective states or even corresponding fully to them. given the feedback in behavioural control by (dis-)liking outcomes of behaviour, i reason that in respect to welfare it is more important for animals to reach proximate goals than to avoid negative stimuli. all behavioural choices are modulated, and i show how mood, a long-term affective state, can cause such modulation. proximate control of behaviour takes place in the brain, and i will briefly discuss how current and future brain research may elucidate how the brain computes these processes. furthermore, the inclusion of affective states in the conceptual model raises the question of the subjective experience of animals, and i will address some of the important open questions in this area of research. i will conclude that neural studies cannot currently provide a detailed and general theory on the algorithms of proximate behavioural control. in parallel to further developing these approaches, i propose to strengthen a refined ethological approach with a focus on the states of ""wanting"" and ""liking"" in ecologically meaningful circumstances and with a strong ontogenetic (within species) and comparative (between species) component. i consider this ethological approach to be a highly promising step in understanding proximate behavioural control.",10.1111/eth.12655,*Animal Emotionality; *Animal Ethology; *Animal Social Behavior; Vertebrates,420,0,0.149332984,-2.587656162,0.077821012,-13.36638814,-0.205588012,-0.308562546

The neurocognitive connection between physical activity and eating behaviour.,,2011,"Joseph, R.; Alonso-Alonso, M.; Bond, D.; Pascual-Leone, A.; Blackburn, G.",": as obesity rates increase worldwide, healthcare providers require methods to instill the lifestyle behaviours necessary for sustainable weight loss. designing effective weight-loss interventions requires an understanding of how these behaviours are elicited, how they relate to each other and whether they are supported by common neurocognitive mechanisms. this may provide valuable insights to optimize existing interventions and develop novel approaches to weight control. researchers have begun to investigate the neurocognitive underpinnings of eating behaviour and the impact of physical activity on cognition and the brain. this review attempts to bring these somewhat disparate, yet interrelated lines of literature together in order to examine a hypothesis that eating behaviour and physical activity share a common neurocognitive link. the link pertains to executive functions, which rely on brain circuits located in the prefrontal cortex. these advanced cognitive processes are of limited capacity and undergo relentless strain in the current obesogenic environment. the increased demand on these neurocognitive resources as well as their overuse and/or impairment may facilitate impulses to over-eat, contributing to weight gain and obesity. this impulsive eating drive may be counteracted by physical activity due to its enhancement of neurocognitive resources for executive functions and goal-oriented behaviour. by enhancing the resources that facilitate 'top-down' inhibitory control, increased physical activity may help compensate and suppress the hedonic drive to over-eat. understanding how physical activity and eating behaviours interact on a neurocognitive level may help to maintain a healthy lifestyle in an obesogenic environment.,",10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00893.x,obesity; Eating behaviour; neurocognition; physical activity,1486,0,0.148195024,-2.614027641,0.108986616,-13.52390626,-0.222174826,-0.292913995

"The Assessment of Risky Decision Making: A Factor Analysis of Performance on the Iowa Gambling Task, Balloon Analogue Risk Task, and Columbia Card Task.",,2015,"Buelow, MT; Blaine, AL","Researchers and clinicians frequently use behavioral measures to assess decision making. The most common task that is marketed to clinicians is the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), thought to assess risky decision making. How does performance on the IGT relate to performance on other common measures of decision making? The present study sought to examine relationships between the IGT, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), and the Columbia Card Task (CCT). Participants were 390 undergraduate students who completed the IGT, BART, and either the ÃÂÃÂhotÃÂÃÂ or ÃÂÃÂcoldÃÂÃÂ CCT. Principal components factor analysis on the IGT, BART, and CCT-cold (n = 112) indicated that the IGT measures a different component of decision making than the BART, and the CCT-cold weakly correlated with early IGT trials. Results of the exploratory factor analysis on the IGT, BART, and CCT-hot (n = 108) revealed a similar picture: the IGT and BART assessed different types of decision making, and the BART and CCT-hot were weakly correlated. A confirmatory factor analysis (n = 170) indicated that a 3-factor model without the CCT-cold (Factor 1: later IGT trials; Factor 2: BART; and Factor 3: early IGT trials) was a better fitting model than one that included the CCT-cold and early IGT trials on the same factor. Collectively, the present results suggest that the IGT, BART, and CCT all measure unique, nonoverlapping decision making processes.

Losses as modulators of attention: Review and analysis of the unique effects of losses over gains.,,2013,"Yechiam, Eldad; Hochman, Guy","it has been shown that in certain situations losses exert a stronger effect on behavior than respective gains, and this has been commonly explained by the argument that losses are given more weight in people's decisions than respective gains. however, although much is understood about the effect of losses on cognitive processes and behavior, 2 major inconsistencies remain. first, recent empirical evidence fails to demonstrate that people avoid incentive structures that carry equivalent gains and losses. second, findings in experience-based decision tasks indicate that following losses, increased arousal is observed simultaneously with no behavioral loss aversion. to account for these findings, we developed an attention-allocation model as a comprehensive framework for the effect of losses. according to this model losses increase on-task attention, thereby enhancing the sensitivity to the reinforcement structure. in the current article we examine whether this model can account for a broad range of empirical phenomena involving losses. we show that as predicted by the attentional model, asymmetric effects of losses on behavior emerge where gains and losses are presented separately but not concurrently. yet, even in the absence of loss aversion, losses have distinct effects on performance, arousal, frontal cortical activation, and behavioral consistency. the attentional model of losses thus explains some of the main inconsistencies in previous studies of the effect of losses.",10.1037/a0029383,*Decision Making; Aversion; Performance; *Attention; Prospect Theory,710,0,0.132539119,-2.664322496,0.082851638,-13.56770776,-0.187141209,-0.313902179

Gerard; Lane, Scott D","chronic cocaine users show impairments in cognitive processes associated with dopamine (da) circuitry. medications aimed at bolstering cognitive functions via da modulation might enhance treatment outcome. the trial used a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group design with four treatment arms comparing placebo (plc) to levodopa/carbidopa 800 mg/200 mg alone (lr0), levodopa plus extended release (xr) ropinirole 2 mg (lr2) or xr ropinirole 4 mg (lr4). adults (n = 110) with cocaine use disorder attended thrice weekly clinic visits for 10 weeks. potential cognitive mediators assessed at week 5 consisted of measures of decision-making (iowa gambling task, risky decision-making task), attention/impulsivity (immediate memory task), motivation (progressive ratio task), and cognitive control (cocaine stoop task). the primary outcome measure was the treatment effectiveness score (tes) calculated as the number of cocaine-negative urines collected from weeks 6-10. bayesian mediation examined indirect and total effects of the relationships between each active treatment (compared to plc) and tes. total (direct) effects were supported for lr0 and lr2, but not for lr4. indirect effects were tested for each mediator. notably, 22.3 % and 35.4 % of the total effects of lr0 and lr2 on tes were mediated by changes in attention/impulsivity. the hypothesized mediation effect was strongest for levodopa plus 2 mg ropinirole, indicating that this da medication combination predicted change (improvement) in attention/impulsivity, which in turn predicted change (reduction) in cocaine use. this finding provides modest support for cognitive enhancement as a target for medications to treat cocaine use disorder.",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108800,*Cocaine; *Substance Use Disorder; Bayesian Analysis; Statistical Probability; Treatment Outcomes; *Cognitive Remediation; *Dopamine Agonists; *Levodopa; Randomized Clinical Trials,206,0,0.128420088,-2.576003801,0.078125,-12.87642178,-0.238736057,-0.314660191
A Common Variant in the Patatin-Like Phospholipase 3 Gene (PNPLA3) Is Associated with Fatty Liver Disease in Obese Children and Adolescents.,,2010,"Santoro, Nicola; Kursawe, Romy; D'Adamo, Ebe; Dykas, Daniel; Zhang, Clarence; Bale, Allen; Cali, Anna; Narayan, Deepak; Shaw, Melissa; Pierpont, Bridget; Savoye, Mary; Lartaud, Derek; Eldrich, Samuel; Cushman, Samuel; Zhao, Hongyu; Shulman, Gerald; Caprio, Sonia",": the genetic factors associated with susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) in pediatric obesity remain largely unknown. recently, a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs738409), in the patatin-like phospholipase 3 gene (pnpla3) has been associated with hepatic steatosis in adults. in a multiethnic group of 85 obese youths, we genotyped the pnlpa3 single-nucleotide polymorphism, measured hepatic fat content by magnetic resonance imaging and insulin sensitivity by the insulin clamp. because pnpla3 might affect adipogenesis/lipogenesis, we explored the putative association with the distribution of adipose cell size and the expression of some adipogenic/lipogenic genes in a subset of subjects who underwent a subcutaneous fat biopsy. steatosis was present in 41% of caucasians, 23% of african americans, and 66% of hispanics. the frequency of pnpla3(rs738409) g allele was 0.324 in caucasians, 0.183 in african americans, and 0.483 in hispanics. the prevalence of the g allele was higher in subjects showing hepatic steatosis. surprisingly, subjects carrying the g allele showed comparable hepatic glucose production rates, peripheral glucose disposal rate, and glycerol turnover as the cc homozygotes. carriers of the g allele showed smaller adipocytes than those with cc genotype (p = 0.005). although the expression of pnpla3, pnpla2, ppar[gamma]2(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2), srebp1c(sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c), and acaca(acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase) was not different between genotypes, carriers of the g allele showed lower leptin (lep)(p = 0.03) and sirtuin 1 (sirt1) expression (p = 0.04)., conclusion: a common variant of the pnpla3 gene confers susceptibility to hepatic steatosis in obese youths without increasing the level of hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance. the rs738409 pnpla3 g allele is associated with morphological changes in adipocyte cell size.

Striatal GPR88 modulates foraging efficiency.,,2017,"Rainwater, Aundrea; Sanz, Elisenda; Palmiter, Richard D; Quintana, Albert","the striatum is anatomically and behaviorally implicated in behaviors that promote efficient foraging. to investigate this function, we studied instrumental choice behavior in mice lacking gpr88, a striatum-enriched orphan g-protein-coupled receptor that modulates striatal medium spiny neuron excitability. our results reveal that hungry mice lacking gpr88 (ko mice) were slow to acquire food-reinforced lever press but could lever press similar to controls on a progressive ratio schedule. both wt and ko mice discriminated between reward and no-reward levers; however, ko mice failed to discriminate based on relative quantity-reward (1 vs 3 food pellets) or effort (3 vs 9 lever presses). we also demonstrate preference for the high-reward (3 pellet) lever was selectively reestablished when gpr88 expression was restored to the striatum. we propose that gpr88 expression within the striatum is integral to efficient action-selection during foraging.",10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2439-16.2017,*Choice Behavior; *Decision Making; *Neurons; *Striatum; Mice,419,0,0.128324739,-2.62968114,0.125585754,-12.38270047,-0.352574962,-0.300893547
Computational mechanisms underlying latent value updating of unchosen actions.,,2023,"Ben-Artzi, Ido; Kessler, Yoav; Nicenboim, Bruno; Shahar, Nitzan",": current studies suggest that individuals estimate the value of their choices based on observed feedback. here, we ask whether individuals also update the value of their unchosen actions, even when the associated feedback remains unknown. one hundred seventy-eight individuals completed a multi-armed bandit task, making choices to gain rewards. we found robust evidence suggesting latent value updating of unchosen actions based on the chosen action's outcome. computational modeling results suggested that this effect is mainly explained by a value updating mechanism whereby individuals integrate the outcome history for choosing an option with that of rejecting the alternative. properties of the deliberation (i.e., duration/difficulty) did not moderate the latent value updating of unchosen actions, suggesting that memory traces generated during deliberation might take a smaller role in this specific phenomenon than previously thought. we discuss the mechanisms facilitating credit assignment to unchosen actions and their implications for human decision-making.,",10.1126/sciadv.adi2704,,953,0,0.128306903,-2.613929581,0.074074074,-12.04835931,-0.282793459,-0.31848135
Correlates of economic decisions in the dorsal and subgenual anterior cingulate cortices.,,2018,"Azab, Habiba; Hayden, Benjamin Y","the anterior cingulate cortex can be divided into distinct ventral (subgenual, sgacc) and dorsal (dacc), portions. the role of dacc in value-based decision-making is hotly debated, while the role of sgacc is poorly understood. we recorded neuronal activity in both regions in rhesus macaques performing a token-gambling task. we find that both encode many of the same variables; including integrated offered values of gambles, primary as well as secondary reward outcomes, number of current tokens and anticipated rewards. both regions exhibit memory traces for offer values and putative value comparison signals. both regions use a consistent scheme to encode the value of the attended option. this result suggests that neurones do not appear to be specialized for specific offers (that is, neurones use an attentional as opposed to labelled line coding scheme). we also observed some differences between the two regions: (i) coding strengths in dacc were consistently greater than those in sgacc, (ii) neurones in sgacc responded especially to losses and in anticipation of primary rewards, while those in dacc showed more balanced responding and (iii) responses to the first offer were slightly faster in sgacc. these results indicate that sgacc and dacc have some functional overlap in economic choice, and are consistent with the idea, inspired by neuroanatomy, which sgacc may serve as input to dacc.",10.1111/ejn.13865,*Rewards; *Cingulate Cortex; *Dorsal Horns,394,0,0.127525297,-2.629310277,0.09414025,-12.36520468,-0.21116507,-0.292594367
Predicting human decision making in psychological tasks with recurrent neural networks.,,2022,"Lin, Baihan; Bouneffouf, Djallel; Cecchi, Guillermo","unlike traditional time series, the action sequences of human decision making usually involve many cognitive processes such as beliefs, desires, intentions, and theory of mind, i.e., what others are thinking. this makes predicting human decision-making challenging to be treated agnostically to the underlying psychological mechanisms. we propose here to use a recurrent neural network architecture based on long short-term memory networks (lstm) to predict the time series of the actions taken by human subjects engaged in gaming activity, the first application of such methods in this research domain. in this study, we collate the human data from 8 published literature of the iterated prisoner's dilemma comprising 168,386 individual decisions and post-process them into 8,257 behavioral trajectories of 9 actions each for both players. similarly, we collate 617 trajectories of 95 actions from 10 different published studies of iowa gambling task experiments with healthy human subjects. we train our prediction networks on the behavioral data and demonstrate a clear advantage over the state-of-the-art methods in predicting human decision-making trajectories in both the single-agent scenario of the iowa gambling task and the multi-agent scenario of the iterated prisoner's dilemma. moreover, we observe that the weights of the lstm networks modeling the top performers tend to have a wider distribution compared to poor performers, as well as a larger bias, which suggest possible interpretations for the distribution of strategies adopted by each group.",10.1371/journal.pone.0267907,DECISION making; FORECASTING; RECURRENT neural networks; THEORY of mind; TIME series analysis,1847,0,0.127069948,-2.614547569,0.086705202,-12.76138302,-0.214212264,-0.303853789

An associability decay model of paradoxical choice.,,2018,"Daniels, Carter W; Sanabria, Federico","paradoxical choices in human and nonhuman animals represent substantial deviations from rational models of behavior; such deviations often demand models that incorporate multiple perspectives, including psychology, biology, and economics. the past couple of decades have seen an increased interest in the paradoxical choice of pigeons in 2-armed bandit tasks (2abt) developed by zentall and colleagues. in these 2abts, pigeons, but not rats, systematically choose an alternative that yields less reward over multiple trials but provides more information on events within a trial, over an alternative that yields more reward over trials but provides less information on events within a trial. although current computational models account for much of the extant data generated in studies on 2abt choice, they do not explain, in a trial-by-trial basis, how pigeons learn to ignore some stimuli and not others in 2abts. to address the provenance of this differential allocation of attention, a simple model composed of bush-mosteller linear operators and a pearce-hall-like associability mechanism is proposed. this model, referred to as the associability decay model (adm) of paradoxical choice, adequately accounts for the performance of pigeons and rats in 2abts. the adm yields an untested prediction that is inconsistent with other computational models of 2abt performance, and offers potential explanations for why differences in motivation, social enrichment, and impulsivity alter the degree to which pigeons systematically choose information despite earning fewer rewards. the success of the adm shows that a relatively simple dynamic trial-by-trial model can account for much of the extant paradoxical-choice data while identifying opportunities for further study and refinement of models of 2abt performance.",10.1037/xan0000179,*Choice Behavior; *Computational Modeling; *Rats; *Attention; *Pigeons,377,0,0.126950889,-2.545262563,0.061204344,-12.00854708,-0.301501751,-0.327820689

In this publication, we shed light on the underlying reasons and provide a roadmap for future advances in the field. Based on an international workshop involving leading researchers in the field of SDS, we review current practice, key achievements and initiatives as well as available standards and tools for a number of topics relevant to the field, namely (1) infrastructure for data acquisition, storage and access in the presence of regulatory constraints, (2) data annotation and sharing and (3) data analytics. We further complement this technical perspective with (4) a review of currently available SDS products and the translational progress from academia and (5) a roadmap for faster clinical translation and exploitation of the full potential of SDS, based on an international multi-round Delphi process.",10.1016/j.media.2021.102306,Artificial intelligence; Clinical translation; Computer aided surgery; Deep learning; Surgical data science,1019,0,0.125525844,-2.676738078,0.111848341,-13.49194869,-0.179437643,-0.291899762
Impact of ambiguity and risk on decision making in mild Alzheimer's disease.,,2008,"Sinz, H; Zamarian, L; Benke, T; Wenning, G. K; Delazer, M","decisions under ambiguity and decisions under risk are crucial types of decision making in daily living at any age. this is the first study assessing these two types of decisions in patients with mild dementia of alzheimer's type (dat) by means of the iowa gambling task (igt) and a newly developed, probability-associated gambling (pag) task. while rules for gains and losses are implicit in the igt, in the pag task rules are explicit and winning probabilities, which change from trial to trial, can be estimated. results of the igt indicated that dat patients made more disadvantageous decisions than healthy controls. patients also shifted more frequently among decks, i.e. under ambiguity decisions were taken randomly and no advantageous strategy was established over time by dat patients. thus, not only actual choices but also development of advantageous strategies may be revealing about decision making in the igt. compared to controls, patients demonstrated less advantageous choices in the pag task as well. they gambled more often in the low winning probabilities and less frequently in the high probabilities than healthy participants. patients' performance on both tasks correlated with measures of executive functions. findings of the present investigation are consistent with the early pathological cerebral changes and related (cognitive, emotional) deficits reported for dat. as suggested by our study, decisions under ambiguity as well as decisions under risk are impaired in mild dat. it may thus be expected that patients with mild dat have difficulties in taking decisions in every-day life situations, both in cases of ambiguity (information on probability is missing or conflicting, and the expected utility of the different options is incalculable) and in cases of risk (outcomes can be predicted by well-defined or estimable probabilities).",10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.02.002,Risk Taking; Cognitive Ability; *Gambling; *Decision Making; *Cognitive Impairment,854,0,0.125345502,-2.88119582,0.086556169,-8.775689195,-0.762532021,-0.390431196
Reduced Model-Based Decision-Making in Schizophrenia.,,2016,"Culbreth, AJ; Westbrook, A; Daw, ND; Botvinick, M; Barch, DM","Individuals with schizophrenia have a diminished ability to use reward history to adaptively guide behavior. However, tasks traditionally used to assess such deficits often rely on multiple cognitive and neural processes, leaving etiology unresolved. In the current study, we adopted recent computational formalisms of reinforcement learning to distinguish between model-based and model-free decision-making in hopes of specifying mechanisms associated with reinforcement-learning dysfunction in schizophrenia. Under this framework, decision-making is model-free to the extent that it relies solely on prior reward history, and model-based if it relies on prospective information such as motivational state, future consequences, and the likelihood of obtaining various outcomes. Model-based and model-free decision-making was assessed in 33 schizophrenia patients and 30 controls using a 2-stage 2-alternative forced choice task previously demonstrated to discern individual differences in reliance on the 2 forms of reinforcement-learning. We show that, compared with controls, schizophrenia patients demonstrate decreased reliance on model-based decision-making. Further, parameter estimates of model-based behavior correlate positively with IQ and working memory measures, suggesting that model-based deficits seen in schizophrenia may be partially explained by higher-order cognitive deficits. These findings demonstrate specific reinforcement-learning and decision-making deficits and thereby provide valuable insights for understanding disordered behavior in schizophrenia",10.1037/abn0000164,decision-making; computational modeling; schizophrenia; model-based learning,1274,0,0.124690087,-2.773943569,0.093720712,-10.93062671,-0.67426312,-0.388831442

Impulsivity and risk-seeking as Bayesian inference under dopaminergic control.,,2022,"Mikhael, John G; Gershman, Samuel J","bayesian models successfully account for several of dopamine (da)'s effects on contextual calibration in interval timing and reward estimation. in these models, tonic levels of da control the precision of stimulus encoding, which is weighed against contextual information when making decisions. when da levels are high, the animal relies more heavily on the (highly precise) stimulus encoding, whereas when da levels are low, the context affects decisions more strongly. here, we extend this idea to intertemporal choice and probability discounting tasks. in intertemporal choice tasks, agents must choose between a small reward delivered soon and a large reward delivered later, whereas in probability discounting tasks, agents must choose between a small reward that is always delivered and a large reward that may be omitted with some probability. beginning with the principle that animals will seek to maximize their reward rates, we show that the bayesian model predicts a number of curious empirical findings in both tasks. first, the model predicts that higher da levels should normally promote selection of the larger/later option, which is often taken to imply that da decreases 'impulsivity,' and promote selection of the large/risky option, often taken to imply that da increases 'risk-seeking.' however, if the temporal precision is sufficiently decreased, higher da levels should have the opposite effect-promoting selection of the smaller/sooner option (higher impulsivity) and the small/safe option (lower risk-seeking). second, high enough levels of da can result in preference reversals. third, selectively decreasing the temporal precision, without manipulating da, should promote selection of the larger/later and large/risky options. fourth, when a different post-reward delay is associated with each option, animals will not learn the option-delay contingencies, but this learning can be salvaged when the post-reward delays are made more salient. finally, the bayesian model predicts correlations among behavioral phenotypes: animals that are better timers will also appear less impulsive.",10.1038/s41386-021-01125-z,Decision Making; *Rewards; *Dopamine; *Impulsiveness; *Risk Taking; *Statistical Probability; Animal Learning; Animal Models; Delay of Gratification; Interstimulus Interval,189,0,0.11992965,-2.63880646,0.097607656,-11.26205244,-0.233896468,-0.282245993
Why is the management of glucocorticoid deficiency still controversial: a review of the literature.,,2005,"Crown, Anna; Lightman, Stafford","all endocrinologists would like to make glucocorticoid replacement therapy for their hypoadrenal patients as physiological as possible. many would like the reassurance of a method of monitoring such treatment to confirm that they are achieving this aim. advances in our knowledge of the normal physiology are relevant to our attempts to do this. the cortisol production rate in normal subjects is lower than was previously believed. the normal pattern of glucocorticoid secretion includes both a diurnal rhythm and a pulsatile ultradian rhythm. glucocorticoid access to nuclear receptors is 'gated' by the 11-[beta]-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes, which interconvert active cortisol and inactive cortisone. such complexities make the target of physiological glucocorticoid replacement therapy hard to achieve. the available evidence suggests that conventional treatment of hypoadrenal patients may result in adverse effects on some surrogate markers of disease risk, such as a lower bone mineral density than age-sex matched controls, and increases in postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations. although the quality of life of hypoadrenal patients may be impaired, there is no evidence of an improvement on higher doses of steroids, although quality of life is better if the hydrocortisone dose is split up, with the highest dose taken in the morning. thus the evidence suggests that most patients may safely be treated with a low dose of glucocorticoid (e.g. 15 mg hydrocortisone daily) in two or three divided doses, with education about the appropriate action to take in the event of intercurrent illnesses.,",10.1111/j.1365-2265.2005.02320.x,,1652,0,0.119672122,-2.710528009,0.076481836,-11.40922263,-0.54165193,-0.375900045

The neuropsychology of obsessive compulsive disorder: the importance of failures in cognitive and behavioural inhibition as candidate endophenotypic markers.,,2005,"Chamberlain, S.; Blackwell, A.; Fineberg, N.; Robbins, T.; Sahakian, B.","obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) is a highly debilitating neuropsychiatric condition with estimated lifetime prevalence of 2-3%, more than twice that of schizophrenia. however, in contrast to other neuropsychiatric conditions of a comparable or lesser prevalence, relatively little is understood about the aetiology, neural substrates and cognitive profile of ocd. despite strong evidence for ocd being familial, with risk to first-degree relatives much greater than for the background population, its genetic underpinnings have not yet been adequately delineated. although cognitive dysfunction is evident in the everyday behaviour of ocd sufferers and is central to contemporary psychological models, theory-based studies of neurocognitive function have yet to reveal a reliable cognitive signature, and interpretation has often been confounded by failures to control for co-morbidities. the neuroimaging findings in ocd are amongst the most robust reported in the psychiatric literature, with structural and functional abnormalities frequently reported in orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and caudate nucleus. in spite of this, our relative lack of understanding of ocd neurochemical processes continues to impede progress in the development of novel pharmacological treatment approaches. integrating the neurobiological, cognitive, and clinical findings, we propose that ocd might usefully be conceptualised in terms of lateral orbitofrontal loop dysfunction, and that failures in cognitive and behavioural inhibitory processes appear to underlie many of the symptoms and neurocognitive findings. we highlight existing limitations in the literature, and the potential utility of endophenotypes in overcoming these limitations. we propose that neurocognitive indices of inhibitory functions may represent a useful heuristic in the search for endophenotypes in ocd. this has direct implications not only for ocd but also for putative obsessive-compulsive spectrum conditions including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, tourette's syndrome, and trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling).,",10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.11.006,Neurobiology; Cognition; Response inhibition; Obsessive compulsive disorder; Endophenotypes,1644,0,0.118394456,-2.794408512,0.070075758,-12.65307747,-0.384959234,-0.369011917

Dopamine increases risky choice while D2 blockade shortens decision time,,2022,"Hirschbichler, ST; Rothwell, JC; Manohar, SG","dopamine is crucially involved in decision-making and overstimulation within dopaminergic pathways can lead to impulsive behaviour, including a desire to take risks and reduced deliberation before acting. these behavioural changes are side effects of treatment with dopaminergic drugs in parkinson disease, but their likelihood of occurrence is difficult to predict and may be influenced by the individual's baseline endogenous dopamine state, and indeed correlate with sensation-seeking personality traits. we here collected data on a standard gambling task in healthy volunteers given either placebo, 2.5 mg of the dopamine antagonist haloperidol or 100/25 mg of the dopamine precursor levodopa in a within-subject design. we found an increase in risky choices on levodopa. choices were, however, made faster on haloperidol with no effect of levodopa on deliberation time. shortened deliberation times on haloperidol occurred in low sensation-seekers only, suggesting a correlation between sensation-seeking personality trait and baseline dopamine levels. we hypothesise that levodopa increases risk-taking behaviour via overstimulation at both d1 and d2 receptor level, while a single low dose of haloperidol, as previously reported (frank and o'reilly 2006), may block d2 receptors pre- and post-synaptically and may paradoxically lead to higher striatal dopamine acting on remaining striatal d1 receptors, causing speedier decision without influencing risk tolerance. these effects could also fit with a recently proposed computational model of the basal ganglia (moeller and bogacz 2019; moeller et al. 2021). furthermore, our data suggest that the actual dopaminergic drug effect may be dependent on the individual's baseline dopamine state, which may influence our therapeutic decision as clinicians in the future.",10.1007/s00221-022-06501-9,ANTICIPATION; ATTENTION; D-AMPHETAMINE; Dopamine; Impulsivity; IMPULSIVITY; MODULATION; NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS; Parkinson disease; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; REWARD; Risky decision-making; SENSATION-SEEKING; STRIATAL DOPAMINE,36,0,0.11468835,-2.543444807,0.109720885,-11.52895273,-0.256913794,-0.277293522

Methods
The following electronic databases were searched: Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Pubmed. The database filters limited the search to articles published between 1990 and July 2017 in English or Spanish, including children and adolescents. Articles were read and classified according to the levels of evidence of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and the Downs and Black checklist was used for Measuring Study Quality.

Results
Thirty studies are reported in this systematic review. Level of evidence, quality of the studies, characteristics of the participants, interventions implemented, and outcomes are described.

Conclusions
The study of rehabilitation for executive dysfunction in children with ABI is emerging. Although few high-quality intervention studies exist in this area, which limits conclusions regarding intervention efficacy, results of existing studies suggest that education for parents may be an important component of intervention. Moreover, caregiver involvement may improve the effectiveness of hot EFs rehabilitation interventions, while high intervention session frequency may be important in improving cold EFs.

The empirical status of predictive coding and active inference.,,2024,"Hodson, Rowan; Mehta, Marishka; Smith, Ryan",": research on predictive processing models has focused largely on two specific algorithmic theories: predictive coding for perception and active inference for decision-making. while these interconnected theories possess broad explanatory potential, they have only recently begun to receive direct empirical evaluation. here, we review recent studies of predictive coding and active inference with a focus on evaluating the degree to which they are empirically supported. for predictive coding, we find that existing empirical evidence offers modest support. however, some positive results can also be explained by alternative feedforward (e.g., feature detection-based) models. for active inference, most empirical studies have focused on fitting these models to behavior as a means of identifying and explaining individual or group differences. while active inference models tend to explain behavioral data reasonably well, there has not been a focus on testing empirical validity of active inference theory per se, which would require formal comparison to other models (e.g., non-bayesian or model-free reinforcement learning models). this review suggests that, while promising, a number of specific research directions are still necessary to evaluate the empirical adequacy and explanatory power of these algorithms., highlights:, existing empirical evidence for predictive coding offers modest support., the canonical microcircuit offers a promising, if incomplete, neuronal model of predictive coding., active inference models tend to explain behavioral data reasonably well., further empirical validation of active inference theory is required to test its explanatory scope.,",10.1016/j.neubiorev.2023.105473,Computational Modeling; Active Inference; Bayesian Brain; Predictive Coding; Predictive Processing,938,0,0.109824381,-2.673367795,0.104265403,-9.846732659,-0.624290236,-0.351553835

Hippocampal subfield volumes have been found to differentially relate to component processes of memory. The neural correlates of memory have not been previously examined in marginalized persons who are understudied and underserved. We examined whether hippocampal subfields and entorhinal cortex volumes are uniquely related to indices of verbal episodic memory using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ÃÂÃÂ Revised.

Method
Data was used from a large sample of community dwelling homeless and marginally housed adults (N = 227). Regression analyses were conducted to examine hippocampal subfield volumes (CA1, CA3, CA4, dentate gyrus, subiculum) and entorhinal cortex, and their associations with measures of verbal immediate recall, learning slope, and verbal delayed recall.

Results
Greater CA3 subfield volume was associated with better performance on an index of encoding (immediate recall), but only in older individuals. Greater CA1 and subiculum volumes were associated with better performance on immediate and delayed recall (measures that tap into retrieval processes), but not with learning slope (a more pure index of encoding). Entorhinal cortex volume was related to all components of memory beyond total hippocampal volume.

Conclusions
Our results suggest common neuroanatomical correlates of memory dysfunction in large sample of marginalized persons, and these are uniquely related to different components of memory.

Neuromodulation of reward-based learning and decision making in human aging.,,2011,"Eppinger, Ben; Hammerer, Dorothea; Li, Shu-Chen",": in this paper, we review the current literature to highlight relations between age-associated declines in dopaminergic and serotonergic neuromodulation and adult age differences in adaptive goal-directed behavior. specifically, we focus on evidence suggesting that deficits in neuromodulation contribute to older adults' behavioral disadvantages in learning and decision making. these deficits are particularly pronounced when reward information is uncertain or the task context requires flexible adaptations to changing stimulus-reward contingencies. moreover, emerging evidence points to age-related differences in the sensitivity to rewarding and aversive outcomes during learning and decision making if the acquisition of behavior critically depends on outcome processing. these age-related asymmetries in outcome valuation may be explained by age differences in the interplay of dopaminergic and serotonergic neuromodulation. this hypothesis is based on recent neurocomputational and psychopharmacological approaches, which suggest that dopamine and serotonin serve opponent roles in regulating the balance between approach behavior and inhibitory control. studying adaptive regulation of behavior across the adult life span may shed new light on how the aging brain changes functionally in response to its diminishing resources.,",10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06230.x,cognitive control; aging; motivation; neuromodulation,1482,0,0.101515589,-2.716544326,0.076555024,-10.50541558,-0.651171047,-0.39399252
Intentional inhibition in human action: The power of 'no'.,,2012,"Filevich, Elisa; Kuhn, Simone; Haggard, Patrick","highlights: [black star] intentional inhibition cancels prepared actions without external stop signals.

Psychopathic and externalizing offenders display dissociable dysfunctions when responding to facial affect.,,2014,"Baskin-Sommers, Arielle R; Newman, Joseph P","despite similarity in their disinhibited behaviors, the cognitive-affective mechanisms that characterize psychopathy and externalizing are relatively distinct. one theoretical perspective suggests that psychopathy is associated with an early attention bottleneck that precludes the processing of contextual information, leading to a rigid goal-directed focus. alternatively, externalizing may be associated with an overallocation of processing resources to motivationally salient information, which disrupts the use of cognitive control. in this study, male prisoners assessed on psychopathic and externalizing traits performed a new gaze detection task involving affective faces. as predicted, psychopathy but not externalizing was associated with superior performance on the gaze-detection task when the necessity of using contextual affect to regulate goal-directed behavior was minimized. conversely, externalizing but not psychopathy was associated with increased errors on trials that required participants to use affective expressions, specifically fear, as a cue to inhibit dominant responses. these results have theoretical and applied significance for both psychopathic and externalizing forms of disinhibition. recognition and utilization of facial affect are important for socialization and interpersonal interactions; therefore, any cognitive-affective processes that interrupt the fluency with which this information is processed may be important for understanding the underpinnings of disinhibition.",10.1037/per0000077,Attention; *Psychopathy; *Cognitive Control; *Emotions; *Facial Expressions; *Incarcerated,614,0,0.073875915,-2.809619525,0.077578051,-12.06010221,-0.476425794,-0.390737693

Building on prior research on the effects of alcohol, initial gambling outcomes, impulsivity, and gambling cognitions on gambling behaviors using a chance-based (nonstrategic) slot-machine task, the current study explored the impact of these factors on a skill-based (strategic) video poker task. We anticipated larger average bets and greater gambling persistence under alcohol relative to placebo, and expected alcohol effects to be moderated by initial gambling outcomes, impulsivity, and gambling cognitions. Participants (N = 162; 25.9% female) were randomly assigned to alcohol (target BrAC = .08g%) or placebo and were given $10 to wager on a simulated video poker task, which was programmed to produce 1 of 3 initial outcomes (win, breakeven, or lose) before beginning a progressive loss schedule. Despite evidence for validity of the video poker task and alcohol administration paradigm, primary hypotheses were not supported. Individuals who received alcohol placed smaller wagers than participants in the placebo condition, though this effect was not statistically significant, and the direction of effects was reversed in at-risk gamblers (n = 41). These findings contradict prior research and suggest that alcohol effects on gambling behavior may differ by gambling type (nonstrategic vs. strategic games).

Decisions to Attend and Drink at Party Events: The Effects of Incentives and Disincentives and Lifetime Alcohol and Antisocial Problems.,,2017,"Finn, PR; Gerst, K; Lake, A; Bogg, T","Alcohol use disorders are associated with patterns of impulsive/risky decision making on behavioral economic decision tasks, but little is known about the factors affecting drinking-related decisions.

Methods
The effects of incentives and disincentives to attend and drink at hypothetical alcohol-related party events as a function of lifetime (LT) alcohol and antisocial problems were examined in a sample of 434 young adults who varied widely in LT alcohol and antisocial problems.

Results
Moderate and high disincentives substantially discouraged decisions to attend the party events and were associated with decisions to drink less at the party events. High versus low party incentives were associated with more attendance decisions. LT antisocial problems were associated with being less deterred from attending by moderate and high disincentives. LT alcohol problems were associated with greater attendance at high party incentive contexts. LT alcohol problems were associated with drinking more at the majority of events; however, the results indicate that young adults with high levels of alcohol problems moderate their drinking in response to moderate and high disincentives. Finally, attendance and drinking decisions on this hypothetical task were significantly related to actual drinking practices.

Conclusions

Understanding ethanol's acute effects on medial prefrontal cortex neural activity using state-space approaches.,,2021,"Morningstar, Mitchell; Barnett, William; Goodlett, Charles; Kuznetsov, Alexey; Lapish, Christopher","acute ethanol (etoh) intoxication results in several maladaptive behaviors that may be attributable, in part, to the effects of etoh on neural activity in medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc). the acute effects of etoh on mpfc function have been largely described as inhibitory. however, translating these observations on function into a mechanism capable of delineating acute etoh's effects on behavior has proven difficult. this review highlights the role of acute etoh on electrophysiological measurements of mpfc function and proposes that interpreting these changes through the lens of dynamical systems theory is critical to understand the mechanisms that mediate the effects of etoh intoxication on behavior. specifically, the present review posits that the effects of etoh on mpfc n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors are critical for the expression of impaired behavior following etoh consumption. this hypothesis is based on the observation that recurrent activity in cortical networks is supported by nmda receptors, and, when disrupted, may lead to impairments in cognitive function. to evaluate this hypothesis, we discuss the representation of mpfc neural activity in low-dimensional, dynamic state spaces. this approach has proven useful for identifying the underlying computations necessary for the production of behavior. ultimately, we hypothesize that etoh-related alterations to nmda receptor function produces alterations that can be effectively conceptualized as impairments in attractor dynamics and provides insight into how acute etoh disrupts forms of cognition that rely on mpfc function., this article is part of the special issue on 'neurocircuitry modulating drug and alcohol abuse'., highlights:, a mechanism is proposed for the cognitive impairing effects of acute alcohol., the acute effects of alcohol on mpfc function are hypothesized to be critical., * a proof-of-concept model suggests how alcohol may alter mpfc activity from a dynamical systems perspective.,",10.1016/j.neuropharm.2021.108780,Cognition; Prefrontal cortex; Alcohol; Attractor; Dynamics systems theory; Intoxication; Up-states,1038,0,0.061567991,-2.791959672,0.095149254,-7.972093905,-0.687452386,-0.369193077

Uncertainty deconstructed: Conceptual analysis and state-of-the-art review of the ERP correlates of risk and ambiguity in decision-making.,,2023,"Botelho, Catarina; Fernandes, Carina; Campos, Carlos; Seixas, Carlos; Pasion, Rita; Garcez, Helena; Ferreira-Santos, Fernando; Barbosa, Fernando; Maques-Teixeira, Joao; Paiva, Tiago O","risk and uncertainty are central concepts of decision neuroscience. however, a comprehensive review of the literature shows that most studies define risk and uncertainty in an unclear fashion or use both terms interchangeably, which hinders the integration of the existing findings. we suggest uncertainty as an umbrella term that comprises scenarios characterized by outcome variance where relevant information about the type and likelihood of outcomes may be somewhat unavailable (ambiguity) and scenarios where the likelihood of outcomes is known (risk).these conceptual issues are problematic for studies on the temporal neurodynamics of decision-making under risk and ambiguity, because they lead to heterogeneity in task design and the interpretation of the to assess this problem, we conducted a state-of-the-art review of erp studies on risk and ambiguity in decision-making. by employing the above definitions to 16 reviewed studies, our results suggest that: (a) research has focused more on risk than ambiguity processing; (b) studies assessing decision-making under risk often implemented descriptive-based paradigms, whereas studies assessing ambiguity processing equally implemented descriptive- and experience-based tasks; (c) descriptive-based studies link risk processing to increased frontal negativities (e.g., n2, n400) and both risk and ambiguity to reduced parietal positivities (e.g., p2, p3); (d) experience-based studies link risk to increased p3 amplitudes and ambiguity to increased frontal negativities and the lpc component; (e) both risk and ambiguity processing seem to be related with cognitive control, conflict monitoring, and increased cognitive demand; (f) further research and improved tasks are needed to dissociate risk and ambiguity processing.",10.3758/s13415-023-01101-8,*Evoked Potentials; *Decision Making; *Uncertainty; *Risk Perception,116,0,0.045979453,-2.761685494,0.040816327,-9.952669678,-0.780734691,-0.46363955
The functions of the orbitofrontal cortex.,,2004,"Rolls, Edmund",": the orbitofrontal cortex contains the secondary taste cortex, in which the reward value of taste is represented. it also contains the secondary and tertiary olfactory cortical areas, in which information about the identity and also about the reward value of odours is represented. the orbitofrontal cortex also receives information about the sight of objects from the temporal lobe cortical visual areas, and neurons in it learn and reverse the visual stimulus to which they respond when the association of the visual stimulus with a primary reinforcing stimulus (such as taste) is reversed. this is an example of stimulus-reinforcement association learning, and is a type of stimulus-stimulus association learning. more generally, the stimulus might be a visual or olfactory stimulus, and the primary (unlearned) positive or negative reinforcer a taste or touch. a somatosensory input is revealed by neurons that respond to the texture of food in the mouth, including a population that responds to the mouth feel of fat. in complementary neuroimaging studies in humans, it is being found that areas of the orbitofrontal cortex are activated by pleasant touch, by painful touch, by taste, by smell, and by more abstract reinforcers such as winning or losing money. damage to the orbitofrontal cortex can impair the learning and reversal of stimulus-reinforcement associations, and thus the correction of behavioural responses when there are no longer appropriate because previous reinforcement contingencies change. the information which reaches the orbitofrontal cortex for these functions includes information about faces, and damage to the orbitofrontal cortex can impair face (and voice) expression identification. this evidence thus shows that the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in decoding and representing some primary reinforcers such as taste and touch; in learning and reversing associations of visual and other stimuli to these primary reinforcers; and in controlling and correcting reward-related and punishment-related behavior, and thus in emotion. the approach described here is aimed at providing a fundamental understanding of how the orbitofrontal cortex actually functions, and thus in how it is involved in motivational behavior such as feeding and drinking, in emotional behavior, and in social behavior.,",10.1016/S0278-2626(03)00277-X,Emotion; Orbitofrontal cortex; Reversal learning; Taste; Face expression; Olfaction; Reward reinforcement,1680,0,0.040214102,-2.643792637,0.064390244,-12.72827429,-0.277605741,-0.364420964
Individual differences in learning during decision-making may predict specific harms associated with gambling,,2020,"Kildahl, N; Hansen, S; Brevers, D; Skewes, J","problem gambling has been linked to impairments in decision-making under uncertainty. problem gamblers are more likely to favor high-risk, high-reward, and short-term gains over more advantageous choice alternatives, and this preference has been linked to impaired learning about decision outcomes. in this paper we link specific learning processes in decision-making to specific harms related to problem gambling. we asked a group of 140 casual gamblers to 1) perform a canonical decision-making task (the iowa gambling task) online, and 2) to complete a self-report survey (the gamtest) designed to measure self-perceived harm caused by their gambling. we used a reinforcement learning model to explain individual differences in the decision task, and related individuals' model parameters to the specific problem areas reported using the questionnaire. we found that people who learned more from gains than from losses on the task were more likely to report overall gambling problems, and problems specifically related to money. we also found that people whose learning was more driven by the frequency of rewards were more likely to report problems related to the amount of time spent gambling, as well as social problems. we discuss possible psychological and neural processes mediating learning and gambling related harms, and we discuss the relevance of our approach to the diagnosis of problem gambling and its consequences.",10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106496,ADDICTION; Cognitive modelling; Decision-making; DISORDERS; GAMBLERS; Individual differences; Learning; MODELS; PERFORMANCE; Problem gambling; UPDATE,41,0,0.039562339,-2.645293613,0.045231072,-13.33021209,-0.271153979,-0.386621327

Cannabis and cognitive dysfunction: Parallels with endophenotypes of schizophrenia?,,2007,"Solowij, Nadia; Michie, Patricia","currently, there is a lot of interest in cannabis use as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia. cognitive dysfunction associated with long-term or heavy cannabis use is similar in many respects to the cognitive endophenotypes that have been proposed as vulnerability markers of schizophrenia. in this overview, we examine the similarities between these in the context of the neurobiology underlying cognitive dysfunction, particularly implicating the endogenous cannabinoid system, which plays a significant role in attention, learning and memory, and in general, inhibitory regulatory mechanisms in the brain. closer examination of the cognitive deficits associated with specific parameters of cannabis use and interactions with neurodevelopmental stages and neural substrates will better inform our understanding of the nature of the association between cannabis use and psychosis. the theoretical and clinical significance of further research in this field is in enhancing our understanding of underlying pathophysiology and improving the provision of treatments for substance use and mental illness.,",,schizophrenia; cannabis; endophenotypes; endocannabinoids; cognitive dysfunction,1622,0,0.037952014,-2.672160716,0.08477842,-9.263812399,-0.692332622,-0.396273335
Developmental risk I: Depression and the developing brain.,,2012,"Weir, John M; Zakama, Arthurine; Rao, Uma","in the past three decades, public health recognition of depression in children and adolescents has increased significantly. the prevalence of pediatric depression is on the rise, and depression during this developmental period is associated with significant impairment in multiple social domains. further, there is evidence that early depressive episodes persist or recur into adult life along with ongoing psychosocial difficulties. a growing body of research has been identifying the neurobiological and psychological correlates. the aim of this article is to describe recent findings on the neurobiology of pediatric depression as well as the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in determining the risk for the disorder. in particular, utilizing data from both animal and human studies, the authors focus on the evolving understanding of the developmental neurobiology of emotional regulation, cognitive function, and social behavior as it applies to the risk and clinical course of depression. treatment implications and directions for future research are also discussed. perhaps the most obvious implication from the current article is the need for more prospective longitudinal research in youngsters. investigators should identify clear structure/function hypotheses that utilize, but go beyond, the current diagnostic system to translate findings from clinical neuroscience research into a new classification system based on pathophysiology and etiological processes. such models also may be able to explain the high rates of comorbidity between depression and other psychiatric conditions. studies of depressed children and adolescents have a number of advantages compared with studies of adults; confounding factors such as repeated episodes, long duration of illness, multiple medications, and co-occurring medical problems are minimized. it is also important to include high-risk youth who have not yet developed a depressive episode to identify premorbid factors. another focus of future research should center on evaluating the stability of biological abnormalities. given that adolescence is a high-risk period for the onset of depression, in a relatively short follow-up period, it is possible to identify both preexisting and ""scar"" markers of the illness. it is important to obtain functional neuroimaging measures before and after pharmacologic or behavioral interventions. results from such studies will shed light on the mechanisms through which treatments work and may provide new intervention targets for drug development. in addition to identifying potential mediators of different treatments, it is important for neuroimaging studies to identify baseline predictors of treatment outcome (ie, the moderators). the identification of mediators and moderators of treatment would help move the field toward more ""personalized"" care. exciting times lie ahead in our efforts to tackle the mechanisms involved in pediatric depression and its treatment response.",10.1016/j.chc.2012.01.004,Neurobiology; *Major Depression; *Brain; Environmental Effects; *Genetics; *Clinical Neuroscience; *Pathophysiology,733,0,0.031472788,-2.630414365,0.041584158,-13.5269581,-0.285825027,-0.397164701
