OBJECTIVE To leverage a human data set of cannabis users and a rat model to evaluate the long-term outcomes of adolescent THC exposure on adult decision-making and impulse control. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This translational rat study tested the link between adolescent THC exposure and adulthood decision-making. A reanalysis of a previously published dataset of human chronic cannabis users was conducted to evaluate decision-making phenotypes. Computational modeling assessed the human and animal results in a single framework. Data were collected from 2017 to 2020 and analyzed from 2020 to 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Decision-making was measured by the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and Rat Gambling Task (rGT). Impulse control was assessed in the rat model. Computational modeling was used to determine reward and punishment learning rates and learning strategy used by cannabis users and THC-exposed rats. Cell-specific molecular measures were conducted in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. RESULTS Of 37 participants, 24 (65%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 33.0 (8.3) years.

These animals were also uniquely susceptible to increased cognitive impairments after reexposure to THC in adulthood, which was correlated with even greater reward learning (r = -0.525; P < .001) and a shift in strategy (r = 0.502; P < .001), similar to results seen in human cannabis users. Molecular studies revealed that adolescent THC dose differentially affected cannabinoid-1 receptor messenger RNA expression in the prelimbic cortex and basolateral amygdala in a layer-and cell-specific manner. Further, astrocyte glial fibrillary acidic protein messenger RNA expression associated with cognitive deficits apparent with adult THC reexposure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this translational study, high-dose adolescent THC exposure was associated with cognitive vulnerability in adulthood, especially with THC re-exposure. These data also suggest a link between astrocytes and cognition that altogether provides important insights regarding the neurobiological genesis of risky cannabis use that may help promote prevention and treatment efforts."	32	0	1	0	0	4	4	1	1	0	3	1	0	2	2	5	4	5	5	1	2

Modeling results allow us to interpret this difference as potentially being because of rapid forgetting of trial-to-trial information. This work furthers our understanding of SCD, while demonstrating the use of computational modeling in the interpretation of neuropsychological data.

Nevertheless, we suggest that in nonpathological contexts, ""wanting"" and ""liking"" interact with major cognitive processes to guide goal-directed actions.

Although this definition has spurred considerable research, the clinical impact of the research conducted has been less robust. The current review takes a more contemporary approach by conceptualizing craving as the breakdown of executive function and relative strengthening of the limbic system, occurring in the presence of conditioned cues, leading to a maladaptive craving response (ie, an increased likelihood of drug consumption). Working from this framework, the present review focuses on four issues in drug craving research: pivotal findings and limitations of cue-reactivity and neurocognitive tasks; two main processes of craving that include self-control and reward-based explanations; integration of neuroeconomic approaches to craving; and the theoretical implications and future directions of drug craving research."	10.2147/NAN.S38866	"craving, competing decision systems, executive function, loss of control, substance abuse"		2130	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	3	1	0	1	0	0	2	1	2	2	5	1

The theoretical and clinical significance of further research in this field is in enhancing our understanding of underlying pathophysiology and improving the provision of treatments for substance use and mental illness., (C) 2007 Canadian Medical Association; Association medicale canadienne"	1622	0	1	0	0	4	4	1	1	0	3	1	0	2	2	5	4	5	5	1	2

Cannabis and alcohol users were matched on levels of alcohol consumption. Cannabis users sampled to the lowest degree of certainty before making a decision on the task. Group differences remained significant after controlling for relevant substance use and clinical confounds (e.g., anxiety, depressive symptoms, alcohol, and ecstasy use). Poor performance on multiple IST indices was associated with an earlier age of onset of regular cannabis use and greater duration of exposure to cannabis, after controlling for recent use. Alcohol users did not differ from controls on any IST measure. Exposure to cannabis during adolescence is associated with increased risky and impulsive decision making, with users adopting strategies with higher levels of uncertainty and inefficient utilisation of information. The young cannabis users did show sensitivity to losses, suggesting that greater impulsivity early in their drug using career is more evident when there is a lack of negative consequences. This provides a window of opportunity for intervention before the onset of cannabis dependence."	10.1007/s00213-011-2486-y	Decision making; Cannabis; Adolescence; Alcohol; Reflection impulsivity		2216	0	1	2	2	2	2	1	1	0	3	1	0	2	2	5	4	5	5	8	2

Reward-based learning as a function of severity of substance abuse risk in drug-naive youth with ADHD.	2018	Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology	1044-5463	28	8	547-553	"Parvaz, Muhammad A; Kim, Kristen; Froudist-Walsh, Sean; Newcorn, Jeffrey H; Ivanov, Iliyan"	English	"attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is associated with elevated risk for later development of substance use disorders (sud), specifically because youth with adhd, similar to individuals with sud, exhibit deficits in learning abilities and reward processing. another known risk factor for sud is familial history of substance dependence. youth with familial sud history show reward processing deficits, higher prevalence of externalizing disorders, and higher impulsivity scores. thus, the main objective of this proof-of-concept study is to investigate whether risk loading (adhd and parental substance use) for developing sud in drug-naive youth impacts reward-related learning. forty-one drug-naive youth, stratified into three groups: healthy controls (hc, n = 13; neither adhd nor parental sud), low risk (lr, n = 13; adhd only), and high risk (hr, n = 15; adhd and parental sud), performed a novel anticipation, conflict, and reward (acr) task. in addition to conventional reaction time (rt) and accuracy analyses, we analyzed computational variables including learning rates and assessed the influence of learned predictions of reward probability and stimulus congruency on rt. the multivariate anova on learning rate, congruence, and prediction revealed a significant main group effect across these variables [f(3, 37) = 3.79, p = 0.018]. there were significant linear effects for learning rate (contrast estimate = 0.181, p = 0.038) and the influence of stimulus congruency on rts (contrast estimate = 1.16, p = 0.017). post hoc comparisons revealed that hr youth showed the most significant deficits in accuracy and learning rates, while stimulus congruency had a lower impact on rts in this group. lr youth showed scores between those of the hc and hr youth. conclusion: these preliminary results suggest that deficits in learning and in adjusting to task difficulty are a function of increasing risk loading for sud in drug-naive youth. these results also highlight the importance of developing and applying computational models to study intricate details in behavior that typical analytic methodology may not be sensitive to."	10.1089/cap.2018.0010	*Rewards; *Learning; *Risk Factors; *Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; *Drug Abuse	"Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with elevated risk for later development of substance use disorders (SUD), specifically because youth with ADHD, similar to individuals with SUD, exhibit deficits in learning abilities and reward processing. Another known risk factor for SUD is familial history of substance dependence. Youth with familial SUD history show reward processing deficits, higher prevalence of externalizing disorders, and higher impulsivity scores. Thus, the main objective of this proof-of-concept study is to investigate whether risk loading (ADHD and parental substance use) for developing SUD in drug-naive youth impacts reward-related learning. Methods: Forty-one drug-naive youth, stratified into three groups: Healthy Controls (HC, n = 13; neither ADHD nor parental SUD), Low Risk (LR, n = 13; ADHD only), and High Risk (HR, n = 15; ADHD and parental SUD), performed a novel Anticipation, Conflict, and Reward (ACR) task. In addition to conventional reaction time (RT) and accuracy analyses, we analyzed computational variables including learning rates and assessed the influence of learned predictions of reward probability and stimulus congruency on RT. Results: The multivariate ANOVA on learning rate, congruence, and prediction revealed a significant main Group effect across these variables [F(3, 37) = 3.79, p = 0.018]. There were significant linear effects for learning rate (Contrast Estimate = 0.181, p = 0.038) and the influence of stimulus congruency on RTs (Contrast Estimate = 1.16, p = 0.017). Post hoc comparisons revealed that HR youth showed the most significant deficits in accuracy and learning rates, while stimulus congruency had a lower impact on RTs in this group. LR youth showed scores between those of the HC and HR youth. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that deficits in learning and in adjusting to task difficulty are a function of increasing risk loading for SUD in drug-naive youth.

Building on prior research on the effects of alcohol, initial gambling outcomes, impulsivity, and gambling cognitions on gambling behaviors using a chance-based (nonstrategic) slot-machine task, the current study explored the impact of these factors on a skill-based (strategic) video poker task. We anticipated larger average bets and greater gambling persistence under alcohol relative to placebo, and expected alcohol effects to be moderated by initial gambling outcomes, impulsivity, and gambling cognitions. Participants (N = 162; 25.9% female) were randomly assigned to alcohol (target BrAC = .08g%) or placebo and were given $10 to wager on a simulated video poker task, which was programmed to produce 1 of 3 initial outcomes (win, breakeven, or lose) before beginning a progressive loss schedule. Despite evidence for validity of the video poker task and alcohol administration paradigm, primary hypotheses were not supported. Individuals who received alcohol placed smaller wagers than participants in the placebo condition, though this effect was not statistically significant, and the direction of effects was reversed in at-risk gamblers (n = 41). These findings contradict prior research and suggest that alcohol effects on gambling behavior may differ by gambling type (nonstrategic vs. strategic games).

Editorial: bridging the gap with computational and translational psychopharmacology.	2019	Psychopharmacology	333158	236	8	2291-2294	"Flagel, SB; Gordon, JA; Paulus, MP"		"The application of theoretical and computational approaches to the analysis of complex behavior has a rich history in psychology. A shining example of this is the modeling of learning encapsulated elegantly by Rescorla and Wagner (1972), who demonstrated that classical conditioning can be described by a simple mathematical equation. The explanatory power of the Rescorla-Wagner rule and its subsequent expansion into additional areas of behavioral plasticity has enabled the precise mapping of learning parameters onto neural structures and even individual neurons. A plethora of other mathematical models have since been used to describe a variety of behaviors, and to map those behaviors onto their underlying neurobiology. This so-called computational phenotyping is now gaining momentum as a translational tool that can be used to identify process characteristics in both humans and animals with the potential of transforming the field of psychopharmacology. The contributions to this Special Issue on Computational and Translational Psychopharmacology stem from the European Behavioural Pharmacology Society (EBPS) Workshop that was held at the University of Cambridge, in August of 2018. The overarching goal of the workshop was to foster discussion around the nascent subfield we refer to as Computational and Translational Psychopharmacology, and to identify points of convergence for which computational approaches could be used to enhance the translational value of animal and human studies. The manuscripts contained herein demonstrate the potential utility of such approaches and provide a foundation for continuous growth towards a better mechanistic understanding of the complex behaviors that characterize psychiatric conditions and the development of more predictive translational probes."	10.1007/s00213-019-05320-1	DOPAMINE receptors; DOPAMINERGIC neurons; PARTIALLY observable Markov decision processes; PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY		1963	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	3	1	0	5	0	0	2	1	2	2	7	3

Finally, we provide a user-friendly toolbox enabling researchers to easily and flexibly fit computational models on the IGT data, hence promoting reanalysis of the numerous datasets acquired in various populations of patients and contributing to the development of computational psychiatry.

In contrast, if the outcome variable is autocorrelated and gradually fluctuates over time rather than being random across time, it can be useful to quickly alternate between the 2 causes, otherwise the causes could be confounded with a secular trend in the outcome. Five experiments tested whether individuals modify their causal testing strategies based on beliefs about TSDC effects and autocorrelation in the outcome. Participants adaptively tested each cause for longer periods of time before switching when testing causal interventions for which TSDC effects were plausible relative to cases when TSDC effects were not plausible. When the autocorrelation in the baseline trend was manipulated, participants exhibited only a small (if any) tendency toward increasing the amount of alternation; however, they adapted to the autocorrelation by focusing on changes in outcomes rather than raw outcome scores, both when making choices about which cause to test as well as when making the final judgment of which cause worked best. Understanding how people test causal relations in diverse environments is an important first step for being able to predict when individuals will successfully choose effective causes in real-world settings"	10.1037/xlm0000244	causal reasoning; dynamic environments; information search; win-stay lose-switch	(C) 2016 by the American Psychological Association	1273	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	3	1	0	5	0	0	2	1	2	2	7	3

Decisions during negatively-framed messages yield smaller risk-aversion-related brain activation in substance-dependent individuals.	2013	Psychology of Addictive Behaviors	0893-164X	27	4	1141-1152	"Fukunaga, Rena; Bogg, Tim; Finn, Peter R; Brown, Joshua W"	English	"a sizable segment of addiction research investigates the effects of persuasive message appeals on risky and deleterious behaviors. however, to date, little research has examined how various forms of message framing and corresponding behavioral choices might by mediated by risk-related brain regions. using event-related functional mri, we investigated brain regions hypothesized to mediate the influence of message appeals on decision making in substance-dependent (sd) compared with nonsubstance-dependent (non-sd) individuals. the iowa gambling task (igt) was modified to include positively-framed, negatively-framed, and control messages about long-term deck payoffs. in the positively-framed condition, the sd and non-sd groups showed improved decision-making performance that corresponded to higher risk-aversion-related brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (acc) and anterior insula (ai). in contrast, in the negatively-framed condition, the sd group showed poorer performance that corresponded to lower risk-aversion-related brain activity in the ai region. in addition, only the non-sd group showed a positive association between decision quality and greater risk-related activity in the acc, regardless of message type. the findings suggest substance-dependent individuals may have reduced neurocognitive sensitivity in the acc and ai regions involved in risk perception and aversion during decision-making, especially in response to framed messages that emphasize reduced prospects for long-term gains."	10.1037/a0030633	*Decision Making; *Brain; Cognitive Control; *Drug Dependency; Cingulate Cortex; Messages	"A sizable segment of addiction research investigates the effects of persuasive message appeals on risky and deleterious behaviors.
