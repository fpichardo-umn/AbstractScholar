While prospect utility-based modeling has shown to differentiate decision-making patterns between users of different drugs, its relevance in the context of treatment has yet to be examined. This study investigated model-based decision-making as it relates to treatment outcome in inpatients with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders., METHODS: 50 patients (Mage = 38.5, SD = 11.4; 16F) completed the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) within 2 weeks of admission (baseline) and 6 months into treatment (follow-up), and 50 controls (Mage = 31.9, SD = 10.0; 25F) completed CGT under a single outpatient session. We evaluated 4 traditional CGT outputs and 5 decisional processes derived from the Cumulative Model. Psychiatric diagnoses and discharge data were retrieved from patient health records., RESULTS: Groups were similar in age, sex, and premorbid IQ. Differences in years of education were included as covariates across all group comparisons. All patients had >=1 mental health diagnosis, with 80% having >1 substance use disorder. On the CGT, patients showed greater Deliberation Time and Delay Aversion than controls. Estimated model parameters revealed higher Delayed Reward Discounting, and lower Probability Distortion and Loss Sensitivity in patients relative to controls. From baseline to follow-up, patients (n = 24) showed a decrease in model-derived Loss Sensitivity and Color Choice Bias. Lastly, poorer Quality of Decision-Making and Choice Consistency, and greater Color Choice Bias independently predicted higher likelihood of treatment dropout, while none were significant in relation to treatment length of stay., CONCLUSION: This is the first study to assess a computational model of decision-making in the context of treatment for concurrent disorders. Patients were more impulsive and slower to deliberate choice than controls. While both traditional and computational outcomes predicted treatment adherence in patients, findings suggest computational methods are able to capture treatment-sensitive aspects of decision-making not accessible via traditional methods. Further research is needed to confirm findings as well as investigate the relationship between model-based decision-making and post-treatment outcomes.

Instead, temporal discounting on the delay discounting task as quantified by the model is more closely related to externalizing psychopathology like aggression, while temporal discounting on the Cambridge gambling task is related more to response inhibition failures. The methods we develop thus provide a new way to connect behavior across tasks and grant new insights onto the different dimensions of impulsivity and their relation to substance use.

Ninety-two controls were recruited from the community. Participants completed a decision-making task (modified Iowa Gambling Task), measures of impulsivity (Barratt Impulsivity Scale and Delay Discounting), and risk taking (Balloon Analog Risk Task). Decision making was analyzed using a computational model. We tested for group differences using analysis of covariance or Kruskal-Wallis and appropriate post-hoc tests., RESULTS: The groups differed in decision-making parameters (P < 0.001) and self-reported impulsivity (P < 0.001). All post-hoc comparisons were significant on these measures, and indicated stepwise changes in controls, followed by SD, followed by SDPG, with SDPG performing worse on decision making and being more impulsive. Compared with SD, SDPG had greater drug severity (P < 0.001). No group differences were observed in delay discounting or risk taking., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with individuals with substance dependence without pathological gambling, those with both disorders demonstrated worse decision making and significantly more drug-related symptoms. When evaluating patients with substance dependence, clinicians should consider diagnostic assessments for gambling, as the co-occurrence of both disorders may impact clinical characteristics.",Duplicate DOI,Initial DOI Duplicate Removal,250,FALSE,6,66

Main Outcomes and Measures: Decision-making was measured by the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and Rat Gambling Task (rGT). Impulse control was assessed in the rat model. Computational modeling was used to determine reward and punishment learning rates and learning strategy used by cannabis users and THC-exposed rats.

(PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Translational Abstract-A key issue in understanding problems like addiction is identifying what psychological processes contribute to the initiation and continuation of substance use, such as inhibiting desires for immediate rewards (drugs) in favor of long-term goals (sobriety). The better we can quantify these processes using experimental tasks and models of behavior, the better we can predict and eventually prevent substance use. In this article, we develop methods for connecting behavior across different tasks and test whether two different experimental paradigms are measuring the same psychological processes. We show that this method can allow us to get more information about an individual and their propensity for substance use by combining data from two tasks, the delay discounting task and the Cambridge gambling task. When applied to these tasks, our approached showed that both tasks are predictive of substance use in heroin-, amphetamine-, and multiple-substance-dependent individuals. However, the two tasks appear to be measuring different dimensions or subtypes of impulsivity: The delay discounting task measures choice impulsivity, which is related to self-report measures of substance use and propensity to favor rewards that occur sooner in time (as opposed to waiting for long-term rewards); whereas the Cambridge gambling task appears to measure people's ability to inhibit desires to act immediately, referred to as response inhibition or action impulsivity. This method thus allows us to better understand how different behaviors are related, identifying whether two different tasks or models measure the same or different psychological processes.

Specifically, individuals with SUDs fail to settle on a behavior strategy despite sufficient evidence of its success. These learning impairments could help account for difficulties in adjusting behavior and maintaining optimal decision-making during and after treatment.

For meta-analysis, we compared DM performance between suicide attempters (SAs) and patients (PCs) or healthy controls (HCs). The systematic review showed that SAs have greater difficulties in all DM domains. The meta-analysis found worse IGT performance among SAs in comparison with PCs and HCs. A meta-regression did not find differences for age, gender, psychiatric disorder, and clinical status. Our findings indicate that SAs exhibited deficits in DM under conditions of risk though not ambiguity. Worse DM was independent of age, gender, psychiatric disorder, and suggested that DM impairment could be considered a cognitive trait of suicidal vulnerability, a risk factor and an attribute of SAs., Highlights:, * Decision-making impairment in suicidal behavior showed reinforcement learning deficit., * The impairment was described under risk but not under ambiguity conditions., * It was independent of clinical status and seemed to be a cognitive stable trait., (C) 2021Elsevier, Inc.",Duplicate DOI,Initial DOI Duplicate Removal,175,FALSE,2,1033

These events are usually accompanied by the same celebratory sounds and animations that accompany true wins. We argue that LDWs may leverage neuropsychological phenomena that underlie reinforcement learning and contribute to extended or repetitive use and gambling-related harm. While other characteristics of slot machine gambling have been examined by cognitive neuroscientists, this feature has not yet received attention. Neuroscientific methods can be used to assess the impact of LDWs on the human reward system, to assess the claim that these events are a reinforcing and contributing factor in the development of harmful play. Positive findings would provide further persuasive evidence in support of strategies to minimise gambling harm through the regulation of machine design., (C) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",Duplicate DOI,Initial DOI Duplicate Removal,153,FALSE,4,1114

We hypothesize that decision making in ADHD is deficient (i.e. inefficient, insufficiently reflective, and inconsistent) and impulsive (biased toward immediate over delayed alternatives). In CD, it is reckless and insensitive to negative consequences. In depression, it is disengaged, perseverative, and pessimistic, while in anxiety, it is hesitant, risk-averse, and self-deprecating. A survey of current empirical indications related to these disorder-specific hypotheses highlights the limited and fragmentary nature of the evidence base and illustrates the need for a major research initiative in decision making in childhood disorders. The final section highlights a number of important additional general themes that need to be considered in future research., : Ineffective decision making is a major source of everyday functional impairment and reduced quality of life for young people with mental disorders.

We conclude that the limited and fragmentary nature of the evidence base illustrates the need for a major research initiative in decision making in childhood disorders and highlight a number of themes to be considered in this future research., (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",Duplicate DOI,Initial DOI Duplicate Removal,424,FALSE,4,1290

We propose that anxious feelings associated with episodic simulation of possible threat-related future events serve to imbue these simulations with motivational currency.

The activated regions were consistent with the neural circuitry hypothesized to underlie somatic marker activation and decision-making. Specifically, a neural circuitry involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (for working memory), the insula and posterior cingulate cortex (for representations of emotional states), the mesial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (for coupling the two previous processes), the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate/SMA (supplementary motor area) for implementing behavioral decisions was engaged. These results have implications for using the IGT to study abnormal mechanisms of decision making in a variety of clinical populations., Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",Duplicate DOI,Initial DOI Duplicate Removal,142,FALSE,2,1537

Using computational models and statistical methods, we also show that the desire for food does not necessarily translate to a willingness to pay every time, and instantaneous subjective valuation of food craving is an important parameter for subsequent action. Our results further demonstrate the role of parietal N200 and centro-parietal P300 in reversing food preference and possibly point to the decrease of inhibitory control in up-regulating craving for disliked food.

However, computational modeling revealed that individuals with chronic pain were quicker to update their behavior than healthy controls, which reflected their increased learning rate (95% highest-posterior-density interval [HDI] 0.66-0.99) when fitted to the Values-Plus-Perseverance model. This result was further validated and extended on the Outcome-Representation Learning model as higher differences (95% HDI 0.16-0.47) between the reward and punishment learning rates were observed when fitted to this model, indicating that individuals with chronic pain were more sensitive to rewards. It was also found that they were less persistent in their choices during the Iowa Gambling Task compared with controls, a fact reflected by their decreased outcome perseverance (95% HDI -4.38 to -0.21) when fitted using the Outcome-Representation Learning model. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that the estimated parameters had predictive value for the self-reported pain experiences, suggesting that the altered cognitive parameters could be potential candidates for inclusion in chronic pain assessments.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>We found that individuals with chronic pain were more driven by rewards and less consistent when making decisions in our laboratory-in-the-field experiment. In this case study, it was demonstrated that, compared with standard statistical summaries of behavioral performance, computational approaches offered superior ability to resolve, understand, and explain the differences in decision-making behavior in the context of chronic pain outside the laboratory.

Although the utilization of neurotoxic models is still providing major advancements, we pore over these contradictions and try to support possible amendments of neurotoxic models (advocating modern 'in vivo' approaches and recordings extending towards motor thalamus) for pursing the development of new DBS technology.

This study applies dynamic programming ( DP), a technique applicable for such full-horizon, 'global' optimization, to model-based perceptual threshold estimation, a domain that has been a major beneficiary of adaptive methods. The results provide insight into conditions that will benefit from optimizing beyond the next trial. Implications for the use of adaptive methods in cognitive science are discussed.

However, very little is known about what distinguishes decision making by individuals with different disorders or the neuropsychological processes or brain systems underlying these. This is the focus of the current review. Scope and methodology We first propose a neuroeconomic model of the decision-making process with separate stages for the prechoice evaluation of expected utility of future options; choice execution and postchoice management; the appraisal of outcome against expectation; and the updating of value estimates to guide future decisions. According to the proposed model, decision making is mediated by neuropsychological processes operating within three domains: (a) self-referential processes involved in autobiographical reflection on past, and prospection about future, experiences; (b) executive functions, such as working memory, inhibition, and planning, that regulate the implementation of decisions; and (c) processes involved in value estimation and outcome appraisal and learning. These processes are underpinned by the interplay of multiple brain networks, especially medial and lateralized cortical components of the default mode network, dorsal corticostriatal circuits underpinning higher order cognitive and behavioral control, and ventral frontostriatal circuits, connecting to brain regions implicated in emotion processing, that control valuation and learning processes. Findings and conclusion Based on clinical insights and considering each of the decision-making stages in turn, we outline disorder-specific hypotheses about impaired decision making in four childhood disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD), conduct disorder ( CD), depression, and anxiety. We hypothesize that decision making in ADHD is deficient (i.e. inefficient, insufficiently reflective, and inconsistent) and impulsive (biased toward immediate over delayed alternatives). In CD, it is reckless and insensitive to negative consequences. In depression, it is disengaged, perseverative, and pessimistic, while in anxiety, it is hesitant, risk-averse, and self-deprecating. A survey of current empirical indications related to these disorder-specific hypotheses highlights the limited and fragmentary nature of the evidence base and illustrates the need for a major research initiative in decision making in childhood disorders.

Results: Mice developed a preference for the 'safe' option, which was potentiated by amphetamine administration. GBR12909 or modafinil administration increased motor impulsivity, motivation significantly, and risk preference subtly. Conclusions: The rodent IGT can measure different impulse-related behaviors and differentiate similarly acting BD-related drugs. The contrasting effects of amphetamine and modafinil in mice are similar to effects in rats and humans in corresponding IGT tasks, supporting the translational validity of the task. GBR12909 and modafinil elicited similar behaviors in the IGT, likely through a shared mechanism. Future studies using a within-session IGT are warranted to confirm the suitability of DAT inhibitors to model risk-preference in BD.

Indirect enhancement of DA transmission may reduce undue reward-related responding in PG subjects. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Duplicate DOI,Initial DOI Duplicate Removal,204,FALSE,3,2230

We find that there are many commonalities in terms of the brain regions identified across these systems and, as we would expect, all are sensitive to the influence of, or function differently in the context of, depression and adverse early experience. It is likely that the similarity and cross-talk between maternal, affect and stress systems, observed behaviorally, hormonally and in the context of brain function, allows for mood disturbance and early adverse experiences to have a significant impact on the quality of mothering and the motivation to mother.

Social cues recognition abilities were measured by the eye gaze discrimination task and the faux pas recognition task. Social functioning was assessed using the Social Functioning Scale. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association between faux pas and, in particular, the social functioning subscales of the Social Functioning Scale (independence and employment) in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the authors also observed that clinical participants performed significantly worse in both the eye gaze discrimination and faux pas recognition tasks than their healthy counterparts. These findings suggested that impaired social cues recognition in people with schizophrenia may be a possible explanation for their impaired social functioning.

Recent theories suggest that these neural changes also play a role in the shift from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) to depression that often occurs during this developmental period. Cognitive models of the development of GAD highlight the role of intolerance of uncertainty (IU), which can be characterized behaviorally by impairments in decision-making. The present study examines potential developmental differences in frontal regions associated with uncertain decision-making, and tests the impact of IU on these circuits. Methods: Twelve healthy adults (ages 19Ð36) and 12 healthy adolescents (ages 13Ð17) completed a decision-making task with conditions of varied uncertainty while fMRI scans were acquired. They also completed measures of worry and IU, and a questionnaire about their levels of anxiety and certainty during the task. Results: Combined group analyses demonstrated significant linear effects of uncertainty on activity within anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis found a significant interaction of group and IU ratings in ACC. Increased IU was associated with robust linear increases in ACC activity only in adolescents. An ROI analysis of feedback-related processing found that adolescents demonstrated greater activation during incorrect trials relative to correct trials, while the adults showed no difference in neural activity associated with incorrect and correct feedback. Conclusions: This decision-making task was shown to be effective at eliciting uncertainty-related ACC activity in adults and adolescents. Further, IU impacts ACC activity in adolescents during uncertain decision-making, providing preliminary support for a developmental model of GAD.

On each trial, participants chose to execute a low_effort or a high_effort behavior (that required squeezing a hand_dynamometer) to obtain smaller or larger rewards, respectively, while their brainwaves were recorded. We replicated prior findings that tonic FMT increased over the course of the hour_long task, which suggests increased application of control in the face of growing fatigue. RewP amplitude also increased following execution of high_effort compared to low_effort behavior, consistent with increased valuation of reward outcomes by ACC. Although neither phasic nor tonic FMT were associated with decision difficulty or effort selection per se, an exploratory analysis revealed that the interaction of phasic FMT and expected value of choice predicted effort choice. This interaction suggests that phasic FMT increases specifically under situations of decision difficulty when participants ultimately select a high_effort choice. These results point to a unique role for ACC in motivating and persisting at effortful behavior when decision conflict is high. Existing theories and evidence suggest a role of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in integrating effort costs and reward to regulate cognitive control over behavior. However, the precise mechanism is debated. Our results suggest that ACC is involved in overcoming decision conflict to motivate effortful yet rewarding behavior precisely when conflict is high. In this way ACC may be uniquely positioned to motivate and persist at especially challenging goal_directed behaviors.

Here, we show that adolescents, as compared to adults, showed a smaller decrease in both learning rate and exploration over time. Computational modeling revealed that both of these effects were due to adolescents overestimating the amount of environmental volatility, which made them more sensitive to recent relative to older evidence. The overestimation of volatility during adolescence may represent the rapidly changing environmental demands during this developmental period, and can help understand the surge in real-life risk taking and exploratory behaviours characteristic of adolescents.

This nonconformist tendency may be a potential behavioral marker to track drug addiction and help to elucidate the mechanisms of decisions made by female methamphetamine abstainers.

However, very little is known about what distinguishes decision making by individuals with different disorders or the neuropsychological processes or brain systems underlying these. This is the focus of the current review. Scope and methodology We first propose a neuroeconomic model of the decision-making process with separate stages for the prechoice evaluation of expected utility of future options; choice execution and postchoice management; the appraisal of outcome against expectation; and the updating of value estimates to guide future decisions. According to the proposed model, decision making is mediated by neuropsychological processes operating within three domains: (a) self-referential processes involved in autobiographical reflection on past, and prospection about future, experiences; (b) executive functions, such as working memory, inhibition, and planning, that regulate the implementation of decisions; and (c) processes involved in value estimation and outcome appraisal and learning. These processes are underpinned by the interplay of multiple brain networks, especially medial and lateralized cortical components of the default mode network, dorsal corticostriatal circuits underpinning higher order cognitive and behavioral control, and ventral frontostriatal circuits, connecting to brain regions implicated in emotion processing, that control valuation and learning processes. Findings and conclusion Based on clinical insights and considering each of the decision-making stages in turn, we outline disorder-specific hypotheses about impaired decision making in four childhood disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD), conduct disorder ( CD), depression, and anxiety. We hypothesize that decision making in ADHD is deficient (i.e. inefficient, insufficiently reflective, and inconsistent) and impulsive (biased toward immediate over delayed alternatives). In CD, it is reckless and insensitive to negative consequences. In depression, it is disengaged, perseverative, and pessimistic, while in anxiety, it is hesitant, risk-averse, and self-deprecating. A survey of current empirical indications related to these disorder-specific hypotheses highlights the limited and fragmentary nature of the evidence base and illustrates the need for a major research initiative in decision making in childhood disorders. The final section highlights a number of important additional general themes that need to be considered in future research.

Results: Demographic characteristics accounted for significance variance in IADLs (p =.001, R2 =.237). Probability discounting AUC (p =.014, _R2 =.075) and response (in)consistency (p =.046, _R2 =.050) each accounted for significant additional variance in functional ability, as did delay discounting response (in)consistency (p =.010, _R2 =.081). Delay discounting AUC did not add significantly to the model (p =.861). Conclusions: Discounting preferences and choice consistency hold potential to serve as relatively fast and inexpensive markers of functional decline, likely due to neurocognitive deterioration relevant to both behavioral economic decision making and functional independence.

Results demonstrate that an individual's decision making is altered depending on the congruency between brand valence (liked/not) and the deck reward structure. This bias was sometimes advantageous and led to faster and more accurate decisions. From an applied perspective, the study suggests several ways in which brands can either enhance or inhibit new product success. More broadly, the research demonstrates a seemingly irrational effect of brands on behaviour. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message To improve depression treatment outcomes, it is important to focus on promoting positive affect in addition to reducing negative affect., Existing therapeutic elements (including activation scheduling, positive data logs, mindfulness, positive psychology and narrative therapy techniques) and novel experimental approaches (e.g., computerized bias modification, imagery, compassion and memory elaboration techniques) all show promise for building positive affect in depression., However, to maximize the potential of these techniques, a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms through which they act to influence positive affect is needed., Moreover, it is important to not over-emphasize positive affect repair in therapy, as this could be experienced as invalidating by clients and lead to the adoption of inflexible emotion regulation strategies.

Disruption of the PFC in addiction underlies not only compulsive drug taking but also accounts for the disadvantageous behaviours that are associated with addiction and the erosion of free will.

Recent theories suggest that these neural changes also play a role in the shift from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) to depression that often occurs during this developmental period. Cognitive models of the development of GAD highlight the role of intolerance of uncertainty (IU), which can be characterized behaviorally by impairments in decision-making. The present study examines potential developmental differences in frontal regions associated with uncertain decision-making, and tests the impact of IU on these circuits. Methods: Twelve healthy adults (ages 19Ð36) and 12 healthy adolescents (ages 13Ð17) completed a decision-making task with conditions of varied uncertainty while fMRI scans were acquired. They also completed measures of worry and IU, and a questionnaire about their levels of anxiety and certainty during the task. Results: Combined group analyses demonstrated significant linear effects of uncertainty on activity within anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis found a significant interaction of group and IU ratings in ACC. Increased IU was associated with robust linear increases in ACC activity only in adolescents. An ROI analysis of feedback-related processing found that adolescents demonstrated greater activation during incorrect trials relative to correct trials, while the adults showed no difference in neural activity associated with incorrect and correct feedback. Conclusions: This decision-making task was shown to be effective at eliciting uncertainty-related ACC activity in adults and adolescents. Further, IU impacts ACC activity in adolescents during uncertain decision-making, providing preliminary support for a developmental model of GAD.

The relation of body fat mass and distribution to markers of chronic inflammation.,2001,International Journal of Obesity & Related Metabolic Disorders,3070565,25,10,1407,"Festa, A; D'Agostino Jr, R; Williams, K; Karter, A J; Mayer-Davis, E J; Tracy, R P; Haffner, S M",,"to study the relation of fibrinogen and c-reactive protein (crp) to various measures of body fat and body fat distribution and to investigate whether these relations were explained by differences in insulin sensitivity. design and subjects: cross-sectional analysis of the iras (insulin resistance atherosclerosis study), a large (n = 1559) triethnic population (non-hispanic whites, african-americans and mexican-americans) across different states of glucose tolerance. measurements: glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test), insulin sensitivity (frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and minimal model analysis), assessment of body fat mass and distribution (weight, girths, bioelectrical impedance), subclinical atherosclerosis (b-mode ultrasonography of carotid artery intima-media thickness, imt), crp (highly sensitive immunoassay), fibrinogen (standard assay). both crp and fibrinogen were related to all measures of body fat. strong correlations (correlation coefficient r ³ 0.35) were found between crp and body mass index (bmi), waist circumference and adipose body mass, respectively. the associations were consistent in non-diabetic and type-2 diabetic subjects, were generally stronger in women, and were only moderately attenuated by the prevailing insulin sensitivity (s[sub i]). in a multivariate linear regression model waist circumference explained 14.5% of the variability of circulating crp levels (p= 0.0001), bmi 0.4% (p=0.0067), and s[sub l] 1.7% (p= 0.0001). common carotid artery imt was related to crp and fibrinogen in men, but not in women, and was attenuated after adjusting for bmi or waist. conclusion: our findings show that measures of body fat are strongly associated with circulating levels of crp and fibrinogen. these associations were not explained by lower s[sub l] in obese subjects. chronic, subclinical inflammation may be one pathophysiological mechanism explaining the increased risk of atherosclerotic...",10.1038/sj.ijo.0801792,C-reactive protein; INFLAMMATION; ADIPOSE tissues; FIBRINOGEN,"OBJECTIVE: To study the relation of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CRP) to various measures of body fat and body fat distribution and to investigate whether these relations were explained by differences in insulin sensitivity. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Cross-sectional analysis of the IRAS (Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study), a large (n = 1559) triethnic population (non-Hispanic whites, African-Americans and Mexican-Americans) across different states of glucose tolerance. MEASUREMENTS: Glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test), insulin sensitivity (frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and minimal model analysis), assessment of body fat mass and distribution (weight, girths, bioelectrical impedance), subclinical atherosclerosis (B-mode ultrasonography of carotid artery intima-media thickness, IMT), CRP (highly sensitive immunoassay), fibrinogen (standard assay). RESULTS: Both CRP and fibrinogen were related to all measures of body fat. Strong correlations (correlation coefficient r ³ 0.35) were found between CRP and body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and adipose body mass, respectively. The associations were consistent in non-diabetic and type-2 diabetic subjects, were generally stronger in women, and were only moderately attenuated by the prevailing insulin sensitivity (S[sub I]). In a multivariate linear regression model waist circumference explained 14.5% of the variability of circulating CRP levels (P= 0.0001), BMI 0.4% (P=0.0067), and S[sub l] 1.7% (P= 0.0001). Common carotid artery IMT was related to CRP and fibrinogen in men, but not in women, and was attenuated after adjusting for BMI or waist. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that measures of body fat are strongly associated with circulating levels of CRP and fibrinogen. These associations were not explained by lower S[sub l] in obese subjects. Chronic, subclinical inflammation may be one pathophysiological mechanism explaining the increased risk of atherosclerotic...

Association of poorly controlled diabetes with low serum leptin in morbid obesity.,1997,International Journal of Obesity & Related Metabolic Disorders,3070565,21,7,556,"Clment, K; Lahlou, N; Ruiz, J; Hager, J; Bougnres, P; Basdevant, A; Guy-Grand, B; Froguel, P",,"leptin may be involved in the regulation of body weight, food intake, and energy expenditure. in view of a possible link between leptin concentrations and diabetes that has been suggested in obese rodents, we investigated the potential relationship between serum leptin concentrations and hyperglycaemia in french patients with morbid obesity. subjects: fasting leptin concentrations were measured in 241 morbidly obese patients with various degrees of glucose tolerance in a cross-sectional study. fasting serum leptin concentrations did not differ between normoglycaemic (ng, 61.5±24.0 ng/ml) and glucose intolerant morbidly obese subjects (igt, 56.5±18.5 ng/ml) and were slightly lower in those with controlled diabetes (55.1±30.3 ng/ml, p=0.06 when compared to ng subjects). in contrast, leptin concentrations were 30% lower in patients with poorly controlled diabetes (43.0±22.2 ng/ml, p=0.001 vs ng subjects). leptin concentrations were negatively correlated with fasting glucose in all groups combined (_=-0.24, p=0.0001) and particularly in niddm subjects (_=0.31, p=0.0054). although leptin concentrations were higher in women than in men, similar significant correlation with fasting glucose was found when females were analyzed separately. a positive correlation was found with bmi (_=0.25, p=0.0001) in all groups. multivariate analysis revealed that fasting glucose was independently associated with serum leptin concentrations (f=12.5, p=0.0005). sex, age, bmi, waist/hip ratio, fasting glucose and insulin, total cholesterol and triglycerides, tested in the model, explained 42% of the leptin variability in this population. poorly controlled diabetes was accompanied by a significant reduction of serum leptin concentrations in morbidly obese subjects. we suggest that a relative leptin deficiency (lower than expected for the bmi) associated with insulin deficiency in this population might contribute to...",10.1038/sj.ijo.0800440,OBESITY; HYPERGLYCEMIA; FRANCE; LEPTIN,"OBJECTIVES: Leptin may be involved in the regulation of body weight, food intake, and energy expenditure. In view of a possible link between leptin concentrations and diabetes that has been suggested in obese rodents, we investigated the potential relationship between serum leptin concentrations and hyperglycaemia in French patients with morbid obesity. SUBJECTS: Fasting leptin concentrations were measured in 241 morbidly obese patients with various degrees of glucose tolerance in a cross-sectional study. RESULTS: Fasting serum leptin concentrations did not differ between normoglycaemic (NG, 61.5±24.0 ng/ml) and glucose intolerant morbidly obese subjects (IGT, 56.5±18.5 ng/ml) and were slightly lower in those with controlled diabetes (55.1±30.3 ng/ml, P=0.06 when compared to NG subjects). In contrast, leptin concentrations were 30% lower in patients with poorly controlled diabetes (43.0±22.2 ng/ml, P=0.001 vs NG subjects).

Although leptin concentrations were higher in women than in men, similar significant correlation with fasting glucose was found when females were analyzed separately. A positive correlation was found with BMI (_=0.25, P=0.0001) in all groups.
