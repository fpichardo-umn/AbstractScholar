Mean age, BMI, fasting insulin, and total cholesterol at baseline (6 weeks' postpartum test) were similar in the three study groups (i.e., normal, IGT, and diabetes). Fasting glucose levels, insulin-to-glucose ratios, and homocysteine levels were significantly higher in the diabetic group (P < 0.05). Higher glucose at the time of the diagnosis of GDM and higher homocysteine levels at baseline were independently associated with the onset of postpartum diabetes. These relationships were independent of age, BMI, and family history of diabetes., CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study identified homocysteine level as a significant risk factor for development of diabetes in women with previous GDM., (C) 2005 by the American Diabetes Association, Inc.",0.0,0.020257096,Irrelevant,D,Irrelevant

The patients with MS had significantly higher values of homeostasis model assessment indexes of IR (HOMA-IR) (p=0.027; p= 0.028). The percentage of IS (HOMA2 %S) and whole body IS index (ISI Matsuda) showed significantly lower values in the MS patients than in the controls (p=0.005; p =0.001). The insulinogenic index in the first 30 min of OGTT was significantly higher in MS patients (p=0.005). The measures of functional disability and MS progression did not correlate significantly with the investigated parameters of IR and IS indexes. Conclusion. This study demonstrates for the first time the existence of hyperinsulinemia, reduced insulin sensitivity and normal glucose tolerance that indicate the initial phase of IR in the natural course of MS. Additional research is necessary in order to define the mechanisms of occurrence and the impact of IR on the complex pathophysiological processes in MS.

We compared model-derived measures of _-cell function between youth and adults with either impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes to determine if a _-cell defect differentiates these age groups.

Methods
This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Study. Youth (54 Y-IGT, 33 Y-D) and adults (250 A-IGT, 104 A-D) underwent 3-hour oral glucose tolerance tests for modeling of insulin secretion rates (ISRs), glucose sensitivity, and rate sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity was quantified as the glucose infusion rate/insulin (M/I) from a hyperglycemic clamp.

Results
Youth had lower insulin sensitivity despite similar body mass index. Analyses were adjusted for insulin sensitivity. Youth had higher basal ISRs (Y-IGT 200_ÃÂÃÂ±_161 vs A-IGT 152_ÃÂÃÂ±_74, P_<_.001; Y-D 245_ÃÂÃÂ±_2.5 vs A-D 168_ÃÂÃÂ±_115_pmol/min/m2, P = .007) and total ISRs (Y-IGT 124_ÃÂÃÂ±_86 vs A-IGT 98_ÃÂÃÂ±_39, P_<_.001; Y-D 116_ÃÂÃÂ±_110 vs A-D 97_ÃÂÃÂ±_62_nmol/m2, P = .002). Within IGT, glucose sensitivity (Y-IGT 140_ÃÂÃÂ±_153 vs A-IGT 112_ÃÂÃÂ±_70_pmol/min/m2/mM, P = .004) and rate sensitivity (median[interquartile range]:Y-IGT 2271[1611, 3222] vs A-IGT 1164[685, 1565] pmol/m2/mM, P_<_.001) were higher in youth, but not different by age group within diabetes.

Conclusions
Model-derived measures of _-cell function provide additional insight into the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in youth with higher ISRs and _-cell secretion more responsive to glucose in youth relative to adults even after adjusting for differences in insulin sensitivity. It is unknown whether these findings in youth reflect _-cells that are healthier or whether this is a defect that contributes to more rapid loss of function",10.1111/pedi.13113,type 2 diabetes; [beta]-cell function; insulin secretion; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin sensitivity,,0.0,0.094696068,Irrelevant,D,Irrelevant

However, the relationship between iron stores and glucose disturbances is not well defined. We used a frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), coupled with mathematical modeling, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the impact of pancreatic, cardiac, and hepatic iron overload on glucose regulation in 59 patients with thalassemia major. According to OGTT results, 11 patients had DM, 12 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), 8 had isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and 28 patients had normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Patients with DM had significantly impaired insulin sensitivity and insulin release. Insulin resistance was most strongly associated with markers of inflammation and somatic iron overload, while disposition index (DI) (a measure of beta cell function) was most strongly correlated with pancreas R2*. Patients with DM and IGT had significantly worse DI than those with NGT or IFG, suggesting significant beta cell toxicity. One-third of patients having elevated pancreas R2* had normal glucose regulation (preclinical iron burden), but these patients were younger and had lower hepatic iron burdens. Our study indicates that pancreatic iron is the strongest predictor of beta cell toxicity, but total body iron burden, age, and body habitus also influence glucose regulation. We also demonstrate that MRI and fasting glucose/insulin are complementary screening tools, reducing the need for oral glucose tolerance testing, and identify high-risk patients before irreversible pancreatic damage.

Results Least squares mean percent change from baseline in glucose AUC0-2 h during the MTT were _2.4, _9.5 and _11.5%, and during the OGTT were _3.7, _21.4 and _20.1% with placebo, sitagliptin 25 mg once daily, and 50 mg once daily, respectively (p < 0.001 for either sitagliptin dose vs placebo in both tests). Sitagliptin treatment enhanced early insulin response during the OGTT and decreased total insulin response, assessed as the total AUC0-2 h during the MTT. Sitagliptin treatment also suppressed glucagon response during the MTT. The incidence of adverse events, including hypoglycaemia, was low and generally similar in all treatment groups. Conclusions Treatment with sitagliptin significantly reduced glucose excursions during both an MTT and an OGTT; this effect was associated with an increase in early insulin secretion after oral glucose loading as well as a blunted glucagon response during an MTT. Sitagliptin was generally well tolerated in subjects with IGT. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",0.0,0.15877848,Irrelevant,D,Irrelevant

Two thousand one hundred and fifty four (979 boys) children and adolescents with overweight or obesity (median age 12 years) and 1824 (728 boys) children with normal weight (median age 12 years) from The Danish Childhood Obesity Biobank were studied. Anthropometrics, blood pressure, puberty, and fasting concentrations of glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and lipids were measured.

Results
About 14.1% of participants with overweight or obesity exhibited IFG according to the ADA and 3.5% according to the WHO definition. Among individuals with normal weight, the corresponding prevalences were 4.3% and 0.3%. IFG was associated with a higher systolic blood pressure, higher concentrations of HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide (P_<_.0001) and triglycerides (P_=_.03), and lower HOMA2-IS and HOMA2-B (P_<_.0001) independent of sex, age, puberty, waist-to-height ratio, and degree of obesity. Furthermore, IFG was associated with a higher risk for hypertension (OR_=_1.66 [95%CI: 1.21; 2.28], P_=_.002) and dyslipidemia (OR_=_1.90 [95%CI: 1.38; 2.56], P_<_.0001) compared with the group without IFG independent of age, sex, and puberty.

Conclusions
The prevalence of IFG, when applying the ADA criterion compared with the WHO criterion, was 4 times higher in individuals with overweight and obesity and 14 times higher in individuals with normal weight in this study sample of children and adolescents. IFG was associated with a higher risk of hypertension and dyslipidemia compared with their normoglycemic peers regardless of the definition applied",10.1111/pedi.12604,obesity; children; glucose metabolism; impaired fasting glucose,,,0.176442679,Irrelevant,D,Irrelevant

Body composition and genetic variation may also affect the response to intervention. Lifestyle interventions are cost-effective and should be optimized to increase adherence and compliance, especially for individuals in the high-risk group with a low socioeconomic status, so that public health policy can introduce targeted implementation programs nationwide. The aims of this review are to summarize the mid- and long-term effects of lifestyle interventions on impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus and to provide determinants of intervention outcome and adherence, which can be used for future implementation of lifestyle interventions., Copyright (C) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",0.0,0.224202251,Irrelevant,D,Irrelevant

In the post-prandial situation or during perturbation studies, however, estimation of RA and RD becomes more complex because they are not necessarily equal and, furthermore, may vary over time due to gastric emptying, glucose absorption, appearance of ingested or infused glucose, variations of EGP and glucose disappearance. Up to now, the most commonly used approach to compute RA, RD and EGP has been the single-pool model by Steele. Several authors, however, report pitfalls in the use of this method, such as ""paradoxical"" increase in EGP immediately after meal ingestion and ""negative"" rates of EGP. Different attempts have been made to reduce the impact of these errors, but the same problems are still encountered. In the present work a completely different approach is proposed, where cold and labeled [6, 6-2H2] glucose observations are simultaneously fitted and where both RD and EGP are represented by simple but reasonable functions. As an example, this approach is applied to an intra-venous experiment, where cold glucose is infused at variable rates to reproduce a desired glycaemic time-course. The goal of the present work is to show that appropriate, if simple, modelling of the whole infusion procedure together with the underlying physiological system allows robust estimation of EGP with single-tracer administration, without the artefacts produced by the Steele method.

Methods
In the population-representative Hong Kong Chinese ÃÂÃÂChildren of 1997ÃÂÃÂ birth cohort (n_=_8327), the relation of initial size (weight-for-age z score (WAZ) at birth, length/height-for-age z score (LAZ) at 3_months or body-mass-index-for-age z score (BAZ) at 3_months based on the World Health Organization growth standards/references) and growth at different phases (WAZ gains from 0 to 2 and 2 to 8_years, LAZ or BAZ gains from 3_months to 3_years, 3 to 8_years and 8 to 14 years) with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at ~17.5_years, was assessed using adjusted partial least squares regression. Additional analyses further considered growth in late and early infancy.

Results
This study included 3276 of the cohort participants. Higher WAZ gain from 2 to 8_years, LAZ and BAZ gains from 3 to 8_years were consistently associated with higher FPG, adjusted for maternal and infant characteristics, family history of diabetes and household income. Also, higher BAZ gain from 3 to 8_years was associated with higher HbA1c. These associations did not differ by sex.

Conclusions
Our findings suggest different mechanisms could underlie the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance. Factors that drive specific growth at different phases need to be evaluated to better inform child growth management for long-term health outcomes",10.1111/pedi.12838,BMI; fasting plasma glucose; HbA1c; length/height; weight,,0.0,0.242320254,Irrelevant,D,Irrelevant

Overall, the results of our study confirmed that the CS-NE particles achieved better adsorption onto the mucosal surfaces of the fish, elicited great vaccine efficacy and modulated the MALT immune response better than the conventional whole cell-killed vaccine, demonstrating the feasibility of the mucoadhesive nano-immersion vaccine as an effective delivery system for the induction of a mucosal immune response against columnaris disease in tilapia., Highlights:, * We applied a new innovative nanotechnology to deliver vaccine antigen to the mucosal membrane and MALT of tilapia., * Biomimetic-mucoadhesive nanovaccine achieved better adsorption on mucosal surfaces., * Biomimetic-mucoadhesive nanovaccine increased the relative percent survival of tilapia against columnaris disease., * Biomimetic-mucoadhesive nanovaccine significantly increased IgM and IgT genes expression in gill-mucosal immune organ., (C) 2021Elsevier, Inc.",,0.295112974,Borderline,D,Irrelevant

These tests may also have the potential of guiding therapeutic interventions and becoming part of future systematic assessment of suicide risk., (C) Cambridge University Press 2014",,0.38961161,Borderline,D,Irrelevant

Some prior neuropsychological studies have found executive dysfunction in HD, but no clear pattern has emerged. One potential reason for discrepant results in previous studies might be the inclusion of patients on psychotropic and other medications that can affect neurocognitive performance. Therefore, we examined neurocognitive functioning in medication-free HD patients. We also added a novel investigation of implicit learning, which has been found to be abnormal in obsessiveÃÂÃÂcompulsive disorder (OCD) and related disorders. Method: Twenty-six participants meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSMÃÂÃÂ5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) diagnostic criteria for HD and 23 normal controls were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests and symptom rating scales. All participants were free of psychotropic medications for at least 6 weeks prior to the study. Results: HD participants showed no significant differences from normal controls on measures of verbal memory, attention, or executive functioning, including response inhibition, planning, organization, and decision making. However, HD participants demonstrated a trend toward less implicit learning and greater use of explicit learning strategies during perceptual categorization compared to normal controls. HD participants who used an implicit strategy performed significantly worse than controls who used an implicit strategy. Hoarding symptom severity was not associated with neurocognitive performance. Conclusions: HD patients may have a tendency to use explicit rather than implicit learning strategies for perceptual categorization but perform as well as normal controls on many other neurocognitive measures.

Our study aims to develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm-based suicide risk prediction model using cognition in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Participants comprised 52 depressed suicide attempters (DSA) and 61 depressed non-suicide attempters (DNS), and 98 healthy controls (HC). All participants were required to complete a series of questionnaires, the Suicide Stroop Task (SST) and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT).

The mean value of the number of cigarettes was 14.8 (ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ±8.8) and the median value of pack-years in the smokers group was 4.0 (1.5ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ7.5). Smokers group has significantly higher free testosterone (F-T), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), delta 4androstenedione(_4-A), T4, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and white blood cells (WBC). During correlation of all the above parameters and pack-years, there has been significant positive correlation_in F-T and _4-A. The participants with more pack-years showed statistically higher values of F-T and _4-A. There was also a significant positive correlation between total cholesterol, triglycerides, WBC and pack-years of the participants. Prolactin (PRL) has been inversely associated with pack-years. We concluded that the increase of pack-years aggravated lipid profile, WBC and decreased PRL levels, in PCOS patients. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,0.435182691,Borderline,D,Irrelevant

In particular, utilizing data from both animal and human studies, the authors focus on the evolving understanding of the developmental neurobiology of emotional regulation, cognitive function, and social behavior as it applies to the risk and clinical course of depression. Treatment implications and directions for future research are also discussed. Perhaps the most obvious implication from the current article is the need for more prospective longitudinal research in youngsters. Investigators should identify clear structure/function hypotheses that utilize, but go beyond, the current diagnostic system to translate findings from clinical neuroscience research into a new classification system based on pathophysiology and etiological processes. Such models also may be able to explain the high rates of comorbidity between depression and other psychiatric conditions. Studies of depressed children and adolescents have a number of advantages compared with studies of adults; confounding factors such as repeated episodes, long duration of illness, multiple medications, and co-occurring medical problems are minimized. It is also important to include high-risk youth who have not yet developed a depressive episode to identify premorbid factors. Another focus of future research should center on evaluating the stability of biological abnormalities. Given that adolescence is a high-risk period for the onset of depression, in a relatively short follow-up period, it is possible to identify both preexisting and ""scar"" markers of the illness. It is important to obtain functional neuroimaging measures before and after pharmacologic or behavioral interventions. Results from such studies will shed light on the mechanisms through which treatments work and may provide new intervention targets for drug development. In addition to identifying potential mediators of different treatments, it is important for neuroimaging studies to identify baseline predictors of treatment outcome (ie, the moderators). The identification of mediators and moderators of treatment would help move the field toward more ""personalized"" care. Exciting times lie ahead in our efforts to tackle the mechanisms involved in pediatric depression and its treatment response.

In contrast, no clear pattern of neurocognitive deficits emerged from studies in suicide ideators across diagnoses., Conclusions: More studies are needed to clarify the role of cognitive deficits in specific subtypes of individuals at risk for suicide. The findings are discussed in the context of promising research on cognitive remediation and other psychological interventions., Highlights:, * No clear transdiagnostic neurocognitive profile of ideators and attempters found., * Cognitive deficits are most consistently reported in depressed suicide attempters., * Deficits found in inhibition, selective attention, decision-making, working memory., * There is a potential for cognitive remediation as an intervention in this context., (C) 2022Elsevier, Inc.",,0.490734773,Borderline,D,Irrelevant

Methods
The following electronic databases were searched: Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Pubmed. The database filters limited the search to articles published between 1990 and July 2017 in English or Spanish, including children and adolescents. Articles were read and classified according to the levels of evidence of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and the Downs and Black checklist was used for Measuring Study Quality.

Results
Thirty studies are reported in this systematic review. Level of evidence, quality of the studies, characteristics of the participants, interventions implemented, and outcomes are described.

Conclusions
The study of rehabilitation for executive dysfunction in children with ABI is emerging. Although few high-quality intervention studies exist in this area, which limits conclusions regarding intervention efficacy, results of existing studies suggest that education for parents may be an important component of intervention. Moreover, caregiver involvement may improve the effectiveness of hot EFs rehabilitation interventions, while high intervention session frequency may be important in improving cold EFs. Positive behavior supports and specific training based on a cognitive model provided some promising findings, which require further evaluation",10.1093/jpepsy/jsy013,executive functions; adolescents; children; acquired brain injury; intervention; rehabilitation and systematic review,,,0.543146149,Borderline,D,Irrelevant

These findings shed light on the cognitive characteristics of obesity in men, and accent the importance of taking gender into account when developing research paradigms and treatment methods for obesity.

Hippocampal subfield volumes have been found to differentially relate to component processes of memory. The neural correlates of memory have not been previously examined in marginalized persons who are understudied and underserved. We examined whether hippocampal subfields and entorhinal cortex volumes are uniquely related to indices of verbal episodic memory using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ÃÂÃÂ Revised.

Method
Data was used from a large sample of community dwelling homeless and marginally housed adults (N = 227). Regression analyses were conducted to examine hippocampal subfield volumes (CA1, CA3, CA4, dentate gyrus, subiculum) and entorhinal cortex, and their associations with measures of verbal immediate recall, learning slope, and verbal delayed recall.

Results
Greater CA3 subfield volume was associated with better performance on an index of encoding (immediate recall), but only in older individuals. Greater CA1 and subiculum volumes were associated with better performance on immediate and delayed recall (measures that tap into retrieval processes), but not with learning slope (a more pure index of encoding). Entorhinal cortex volume was related to all components of memory beyond total hippocampal volume.

Conclusions
Our results suggest common neuroanatomical correlates of memory dysfunction in large sample of marginalized persons, and these are uniquely related to different components of memory. These findings have clinical relevance for marginalized populations and theoretical relevance to the growing literature on functional specialization of the hippocampal subfields",10.1093/arclin/acy066,Cognition; Memory; Hippocampus; Comorbidity; Neuroimaging,,,0.556728076,Borderline,D,Irrelevant

Results: Compared to traditional AB scores, response-based scores had generally better internal consistency (range of Cronbach's alphas: 0.68ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ0.92 vs. 0.41ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ0.71), higher testÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂretest reliabilities (range of Pearson's correlations: 0.26ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ0.77 vs. _ 0.05 to 0.35), and were more strongly related in family members (range of ICCs: 0.11ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ0.27 vs. 0ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ0.05). Furthermore, three response-based scores added incremental validity beyond traditional scores and gender in the external validators of current and lifetime Social Anxiety Disorder. Conclusions: Findings indicate that response-based AB scores from the dot-probe task have better psychometric properties than traditional scores.

More recently, we proposed that the catecholamines might modulate value-based decision-making about whether or not to engage in cognitive control. We test this hypothesis by assessing effects of a catecholamine challenge in a large sample of young, healthy adults (n = 100) on the avoidance of a cognitively demanding control process: task switching. Prolonging catecholamine transmission by blocking reuptake with methylphenidate altered the avoidance, but not the execution of cognitive control. Crucially, these effects could be isolated by taking into account individual differences in trait impulsivity, so that participants with higher trait impulsivity became more avoidant of cognitive control, despite faster task performance. One implication of these findings is that performance-enhancing effects of methylphenidate may be accompanied by an undermining effect on the willingness to exert cognitive control.

It was concluded that negative symptoms are relatively frequent across diagnostic categories, but individual disorders may differ in whether their negative symptoms are persistent/transient or primary/secondary. Evidence for separate dimensions of volitional and expressive symptoms exists, and there may be multiple mechanistic pathways to the same symptom phenomenon among DSM-5 disorders within and outside the schizophrenia-spectrum (ie, equifinality). Evidence for a novel transdiagnostic etiological model is presented based on the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs, which proposes the existence of 2 such pathwaysÃÂÃÂa hedonic pathway and a cognitive pathwayÃÂÃÂthat can both lead to expressive or volitional symptoms.

The sensory conflict hypothesis is the most widely accepted theory for MS. Both the hippocampus and vestibular cortex might play a role in forming internal model. The pathophysiology focuses on the visceral afference, thermoregulation and MS-related neuroendocrine. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in some genes and epigenetic modulation might contribute to MS susceptibility and habituation. Questionnaires, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrogastrogram (EGG) are useful for diagnosing and evaluating MS. We also list MS medications to guide clinical practice. Repeated real motion exposure and combined visual-vestibular interaction training accelerate the progress of habituation. Behavioral and dietary countermeasures, as well as physiotherapy, are also effective in alleviating MS symptoms., (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",,0.588143146,Borderline,D,Irrelevant

A shining example of this is the modeling of learning encapsulated elegantly by Rescorla and Wagner (1972), who demonstrated that classical conditioning can be described by a simple mathematical equation. The explanatory power of the Rescorla-Wagner rule and its subsequent expansion into additional areas of behavioral plasticity has enabled the precise mapping of learning parameters onto neural structures and even individual neurons. A plethora of other mathematical models have since been used to describe a variety of behaviors, and to map those behaviors onto their underlying neurobiology. This so-called computational phenotyping is now gaining momentum as a translational tool that can be used to identify process characteristics in both humans and animals with the potential of transforming the field of psychopharmacology. The contributions to this Special Issue on Computational and Translational Psychopharmacology stem from the European Behavioural Pharmacology Society (EBPS) Workshop that was held at the University of Cambridge, in August of 2018. The overarching goal of the workshop was to foster discussion around the nascent subfield we refer to as Computational and Translational Psychopharmacology, and to identify points of convergence for which computational approaches could be used to enhance the translational value of animal and human studies.

To determine whether sign-tracking rats also displayed sensitivity to illness-induced outcome devaluation after extended training, we trained a separate cohort of rats in extended PLA and devalued the outcome with lithium chloride injections after pellet consumption in the homecage. ST rats failed to decrease conditioned responding after illness-induced outcome devaluation, while Non-ST rats (GT and intermediates) were sensitive to illness-induced outcome devaluation after extended training. Together, our results confirm devaluation sensitivity is stable in GT rats across training and devaluation approaches. Extended training unmasks devaluation sensitivity in ST rats after satiety, but not illness-induced devaluation, suggesting ST rats respond appropriately by decreasing responding to cues during state-dependent but not inference-based devaluation. The differences in behavioral flexibility across tracking groups and devaluation paradigms have translational relevance for the understanding state- vs. inference-based reward devaluation as it pertains to drug addiction vulnerability.

Its structure reflects five major public health domains, each of which Tony made major contributions to in an extremely productive academic life: occupational health and safety; environmental and social epidemiology; nutrition and food systems; climate change and health; and ecosystem change and infectious disease. The final section,'Transformation', is dedicated to Tony's desire for public health scientists to propose adaptive and mitigating solutions to the problems they were observing.Each section contains at least one key publication involving Tony. There is also a selection of artworks from an exhibition which formed part of the conference held to honour Tony at The Australian National University in 2012. This conference formed the first part of Tony's festschrift, completed by this book.",,0.641905831,Borderline,D,Irrelevant

1060,Family history of depression is associated with alterations in task-dependent connectivity between the cerebellum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.,2021,Depress. anxiety,1091-4269,38.0,5,508-520,"Tepfer, LJ; Alloy, LB; Smith, DV",,"A family history of major depressive disorder (MDD) increases the likelihood of a future depressive episode, which itself poses a significant risk for disruptions in reward processing and social cognition. However, it is unclear whether a family history of MDD is associated with alterations in the neural circuitry underlying reward processing and social cognition.

Methods
We subdivided 279 participants from the Human Connectome Project into three groups: 71 with a lifetime history of MDD, 103 with a family history (FH) of MDD, and 105 healthy controls (HCs). We then evaluated task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging data on a social cognition and a reward processing task and found a region of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) that responded to both tasks, independent of the group. To investigate whether the vmPFC shows alterations in functional connectivity between groups, we conducted psychophysiological interaction analyses using the vmPFC as a seed region.

Results
We found that FH (relative to HC) was associated with increased sadness scores, and MDD (relative to both FH and HC) was associated with increased sadness and MDD symptoms. Additionally, the FH group had increased vmPFC functional connectivity within the nucleus accumbens, left dorsolateral PFC, and subregions of the cerebellum relative to HC during the social cognition task.

Conclusions
These findings suggest that aberrant neural mechanisms among those with a familial risk of MDD may underlie vulnerability to altered social cognition.",10.1002/da.23143,fMRI; functional connectivity; family history; depression,,,0.651279823,Borderline,D,Irrelevant

This paper describes the logic and rationale behind the development of the behavioral, individual difference, and tfMRI batteries and provides preliminary data on the patterns of activation associated with each of the fMRI tasks, at both group and individual levels., Highlights:, * Describes logic for the behavioral battery for the Human Connectome Project (HCP), * Describes logic and development of the task fMRI (tfMRI) battery for the HCP, * Provides data on brain activation associated with each tfMRI paradigm in the HCP, (C) 2013Elsevier, Inc.",,0.685136294,Borderline,D,Irrelevant

Recently, research has turned to frequency decomposition techniques to examine how changes in the EEG power spectra are related to underlying learning mechanisms. Although the literature on the neural correlates of feedback processing is vast, there are still methodological discrepancies and differences in results across studies. Here, we provide reference results and an investigation of methodological considerations for the ERP (reward positivity) and frequency (delta and theta power) correlates of feedback evaluation with a large sample size. Specifically, participants (n = 500) performed a two-armed bandit task while we recorded EEG. Our findings provide key information about the data characteristics and relationships that exist between the neural signatures of feedback evaluation. Additionally, we conclude with selected methodological recommendations for standardization of future research. All data and scripts are freely provided to facilitate open science.

Despite its importance in humans, conscientiousness has received little attention as to how it may have evolved, or whether it provides similar fitness benefits in other animals. To date, research in animal personality has found consistent support for the presence of all major dimensions of human personality in other animals except conscientiousness. In this review, we investigate conscientiousness at the level of traits and facets (clusters of closely related traits). A systematic review of the literature retrieved 876 relevant publications describing attributes of conscientiousness in other animal species. A factor analysis of citation counts revealed 2 major dimensions representing 9 distinct facets of conscientiousness in nonhumans. These facets, together with their underlying personality traits, exhibit individual variability, are generally known to be heritable, and often offer clear fitness benefits to individuals. Other facets of conscientiousness appear to be unique to humans. Publication biases, research biases, and anthropomorphism may all play a role in the structure of the evidence we report.

The development of the modeling algorithm requires a rich, diverse, representative dataset. The primary goal of this research is to develop a method for generating a synthetic protein spot dataset that can be used to develop 2DEG image analysis algorithms. The secondary objective is to evaluate the usefulness of the created dataset by developing a neural-network-based protein spot reconstruction algorithm that provides parameterization and denoising functionalities. In this research, a spot modeling algorithm based on autoencoders is developed using only the created synthetic dataset. The algorithm is evaluated on real and synthetic data. Evaluation results show that the created synthetic dataset is effective for the development of protein spot models. The developed algorithm outperformed all baseline algorithms in all experimental cases. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",,0.746073772,Relevant,D,Irrelevant

Several previous studies demonstrated that a single session of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the DLPFC reduces food craving and caloric intake. Objectives: We hypothesized that repeated tDCS of the right DLPFC cortex may exert long-term changes in food craving in young, healthy adults and that these changes may differ between normal and overweight subjects. Methods: Thirty healthy individuals who reported frequent food cravings without a prior history of eating disorders were initially recruited. Subjects were randomized into an ACTIVE group who received 5 days of real tDCS (20 minutes, anode right-cathode left montage, 2 mA with current density kept at 0.06 mA/cm2, 1 min ramp-up/ramp-down), and a SHAM group, who received one day of real tDCS, on the first day (same parameters), followed by 4 days of sham tDCS. Food craving intensity was examined by Food Craving Questionnaires State and Trait and Food Craving Inventory before, during, (5-days) and one month (30-days) after tDCS. Results: Single session of tDCS significantly reduced the intensity of current food craving (FCQ-S). Five days of active tDCS significantly reduced habitual experiences of food craving (FCQ-T), when compared to baseline pre-stimulation levels. Furthermore, both current (FCQ-S) and habitual craving (FCQ-T) were significantly reduced 30 days after active tDCS, while sham tDCS, i.e. a single tDCS session did not have significant effects. Also, active tDCS significantly decreased craving for fast food and sweets, and to a lesser degree for fat, while it did not have significant effects on craving for carbohydrates (FCI). There were no significant differences between individual FCQ-T subscales (craving dimensions) after 5 or 30 days of either sham or active tDCS. Changes in craving were not significantly associated with the initial weight, or with weight changes 30 days after the stimulation in the subjects. Conclusions: The results confirm earlier findings that single session of tDCS has immediate effects in reducing food craving. They also show that repeated tDCS over the right DLPFC may increase the duration of its effects, which may be present 30 days after the stimulation. These results support further investigation of the use of tDCS in obesity. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",,0.793853795,Relevant,D,Irrelevant

Chapter two discusses emotions within the life-course perspective and highlights how emotions and self-development are intertwined and are affected heavily by social interactions at birth. Chapter three provides a review of the latest neuroscience research that has focused on social aspects that affect the way emotions are processed in the brain. Chapter four discusses sociocultural aspects of emotions and reviews a number of culturally specific emotional disorders that are uniquely shaped by the social context, such as taijin kyfusho and ataques de nervios. Chapter five expands the discussion to the socialization of emotions. Chapter six discusses social emotions in the context of human morality, such as guilt, shame, and pride. Chapter seven examines the social regulation of emotions, and the role of social institutions, such as the legal system and religious organizations, and their influence on emotion regulation. Chapter eight analyzes the social-emotional aspects of common mental disorders. The concluding chapter summarizes the previous chapters and also highlights gaps in the literature and suggests directions for future research.

Results: GWAS summary data were obtained from three combined samples, containing 939,908, 413,466 and 807,553 individuals of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization evidence suggested that risk preference increased the onset of BP, and BP also increased risk preference (P < 0.001). In contrast, there were no reliable results to describe the relationship of risk preference with MDD (P > 0.05). Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between MDD and risk preference. Conclusion: Using large-scale GWAS data, robust evidence supports a mutual relationship between risk preference and BP, but no relationship between risk preference and MDD was observed. This study indicates a potential marker for the early identification of MDD and BP. Additionally, it shows that reducing risk preferences for patients with BP may be a valuable intervention for treating BP.

We found that the reward positivity, an ERP component proposed to index the impact of dopamine-related reward signals on ACC, was significantly larger with money feedback than with points feedback for the children with ADHD, but not for the typically developing children. These results suggest that disruption of the ACC-dopamine interface may underlie the impairments in motivational control observed in childhood ADHD.

Previous studies reported that selenium (Se) deficiency is common in the general population. As Se can be easily added as a supplement, the goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical impact of Se deficiency in patients with AN. Methods: This cross-sectional study concerned 153 patients with AN (92.9% women) followed at the Eating Disorder Unit of Lapeyronie Academic Hospital, Montpellier, France. Patients underwent an extensive neuropsychological assessment, and completed validated questionnaires. Blood samples were collected for Se quantification. Results were compared with the t-test, Mann-Whitney U, and Chi square tests, and univariate linear and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Se plasma levels were below the cut-off of 80 microg/L in 53.6% (N = 82) of patients. AN onset was earlier in patients with Se deficiency, (p = .005), whereas disease duration was comparable between groups (p = .77). General eating disorder symptomatology in the past 28 days (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire) was more severe in patients with Se deficiency (p = .010). The suicide risk (MINI International Neuropsychiatric Evaluation) tended to be higher (p = .037), and suicide attempt history was more frequent (28.39% vs 9.85%, p = .004) in patients with low Se levels. Se plasma concentration was negatively correlated with the performance in the temporal delayed discounting task (p = .006). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that in patients with AN, Se plasma concentration might be implicated in disease severity and suicide risk. The finding that Se deficiency in patients with AN was associated only with reward-related processes, but not with other psychological functions suggests the selective involvement of dopamine-related pathways. Our results suggest that it might be useful to monitor the plasma micronutrient profile in patients with AN. Future studies should determine whether Se supplementation in AN might improve clinical outcomes.

However, this effect was not larger in early-stage AD patients compared to controls and error frequency during acquisition of object locations was unrelated to later recall performance. No group differences were found on the probabilistic learning task with respect to learning performance over time and based on positive and negative feedback. Although the error monitoring system seems intact in patients with early-stage AD, errors during learning are likely acting as a source of interference causing difficulty in storage or retrieval of object locations.

So far, it is unclear what aspects of addictive behaviors are related to a dopaminergic dysfunction. Discussion: We hypothesize that a decrease in dopaminergic activity impairs emotion-based decision-making. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of a decrease in dopaminergic activity on the performance of an emotion-based decision-making task, the Iowa gambling task (IGT), in 11 healthy human subjects. Materials and methods: We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design to examine the effect of a mixture containing the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) valine, isoleucine and leucine on prolactin, IGT performance, perceptual competency and visual aspects of visuospatial working memory, visual attention and working memory, and verbal memory. The expectancy-valence model was used to determine the relative contributions of distinct IGT components (attention to past outcomes, relative weight of wins and losses, and choice strategies) in the decision-making process. Observations and results: Compared to placebo, the BCAA mixture increased prolactin levels and impaired IGT performance. BCAA administration interfered with a particular component process of decision-making related to attention to more recent events as compared to more distant events. There were no differences between placebo and BCAA conditions for other aspects of cognition.

We regressed each of the four facets of psychopathy onto eight impulsivity variables. We followed these analyses with bootstrapped dominance analyses in order to determine which of the impulsivity variables shared the most variance with each psychopathy facet. Our analyses revealed that positive urgency was the most important aspect of impulsivity to all four facets of psychopathy. We further identified distinct profiles of impulsivity linked to each psychopathy facet-the interpersonal facet was typified by sensation seeking and tem poral impulsivity. The affective and lifestyle facets were both typified by general trait impul sivity and affective impulsivity. The antisocial facet was typified by affective impulsivity and sensation seeking. Such distinct profiles of impulsivity suggest that specific behaviors linked with each facet (e.g., manipulativeness and the interpersonal facet) may be explained in part by the distinct forms of impulsivity aligned with them.

(PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement General Scientific Summary-This study suggests that bipolar disorders during adolescence-a period of maturational changes in reward-motivated behavior-are characterized by abnormalities in multiple facets of the reward system. One of these abnormalities is reliance on inefficient strategies for learning the reward value of environmental stimuli. This abnormality appears to predict which adolescents have a bipolar disorder, beyond the predictive ability of already established reward processing and cognitive deficits.

A total of 96 studies were included in our review, following PRISMA guidelines. The review suggests that individuals with binge eating behaviours 1) are more likely to expend greater effort for food rewards, but not monetary rewards, 2) demonstrate greater decision-making impairments under risk and uncertainty, 3) prefer sooner rather than delayed rewards for both food and money, and 4) demonstrate increased implicit 'wanting' for high fat sweet foods. Finally, individual differences in effort and reward -processing measures relating to eating pathology and treatment measures are also discussed.

However, tasks traditionally used to assess such deficits often rely on multiple cognitive and neural processes, leaving etiology unresolved. In the current study, we adopted recent computational formalisms of reinforcement learning to distinguish between model-based and model-free decision-making in hopes of specifying mechanisms associated with reinforcement-learning dysfunction in schizophrenia. Under this framework, decision-making is model-free to the extent that it relies solely on prior reward history, and model-based if it relies on prospective information such as motivational state, future consequences, and the likelihood of obtaining various outcomes. Model-based and model-free decision-making was assessed in 33 schizophrenia patients and 30 controls using a 2-stage 2-alternative forced choice task previously demonstrated to discern individual differences in reliance on the 2 forms of reinforcement-learning. We show that, compared with controls, schizophrenia patients demonstrate decreased reliance on model-based decision-making. Further, parameter estimates of model-based behavior correlate positively with IQ and working memory measures, suggesting that model-based deficits seen in schizophrenia may be partially explained by higher-order cognitive deficits.

(PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Translational Abstract-Over 250 years ago, Bayes (or Price, or Laplace) introduced a method to take prior knowledge into account in data analysis. Although these ideas and Bayes's theorem have been longstanding within the fields of mathematics and statistics, these tools have not been at the forefront of modern-day applied psychological research. It was frequentist statistics (i.e., p values and null hypothesis testing; developed by Fisher, Neyman, and Pearson long after Bayes's theorem), which has dominated the field of Psychology throughout the 21st century. However, it is often claimed by 'Bayesians' that the alternative Bayesian approach to statistics is gaining in popularity. In the current article, we investigated this claim by performing the very first systematic review of Bayesian psychological articles published between 1990 and 2015 (n = 1,579). Our findings showed that there was some merit in this thought. In fact, the use of Bayesian methods in applied Psychological work has steadily increased since the nineties and is currently taking flight. It was clear in this review that Bayesian statistics is used in a variety of contexts across subfields of Psychology and related disciplines. This is an exciting time, where we can watch the field of applied statistics change more than ever before. The way in which researchers think about and answer substantive inquiries is slowly taking on a new philosophical meaning that now incorporates previous knowledge and opinions into the estimation process. We hope this presentation opens the door for a larger discussion regarding the current state of Bayesian statistics, as well as future trends.

Taking a developmental approach to investigating reward function in adolescent depression can elucidate the etiology, pathophysiology and course of depression, a disorder that typically begins during adolescence and has high rates of recurrence.

Peer-reviewed empirical papers for inclusion in this critical review were obtained by searching PubMed, PsycInfo and ScienceDirect for the years 1990-2010. Results: A pattern of low striatal response and high medial prefrontal response to reward is evident in adolescents and adults with depression. Given the salience of social stimuli for positive affect and depression, reward function might be especially disrupted in response to social rewards. Because of changes in the dopamine system and reward function with aging, altered reward function in depression might be more evident during adolescence than later in life; however, low reward function may also be a stable characteristic of people who experience depression. Mechanisms of altered reward function in depression could include disrupted balance of corticostriatal circuit function, with disruption occurring as aberrant adolescent brain development. Conclusions: Future studies should examine responses to social rewards; employ longitudinal and prospective designs; and investigate patterns of functional connectivity in reward circuits. Understanding altered reward function in depression has potential implications for treatment development. A more rigorous approach to investigating anhedonia, threat-reward interactions and comorbid anxiety will be valuable to future progress in describing the role of reward function in the pathophysiology of depression.

To promote a more accurate understanding of the odds of scratch-off ticket gambling, we created a brief debiasing intervention consisting of a digital gambling accelerator program that offers demonstrations of the long-term outcomes of gambling. Using a sample of nontreatment seeking scratch-off lottery gamblers recruited from the community (42 subclinical and 45 probable pathological gamblers), we compared the accelerator intervention to brief motivational interviewing (MI) and a control condition. Participants rated their chances of winning, urge to gamble, and readiness to change before and after the interventions. Self-reported dollar amount spent on scratch-off tickets and number of days gambled were assessed at baseline and again at 2- and 4-week follow-ups. Following the active interventions, gamblers in both conditions reported greater readiness to change than controls, and those in the accelerator condition also gave lower ratings of their chances of winning and urge to gamble. Marginal models showed participants in the accelerator condition gambled fewer days at the 2-week follow-up and spent less money at both the 2- and 4-week follow-ups compared to controls; no other between-subjects differences achieved statistical significance.
