Targeting goal-based decision-making for addiction recovery.,"Neurocognitive mechanisms of action-outcome learning
A large body of work has implicated three behaviourally dissociable learning systems – Pavlovian, habitual, and goal-directed – which operate according to distinct computational principles. These three systems often compete to control behaviour in everyday life. In neuropsychological models of addiction, the interaction between goal-directed and habitual systems has been of particular interest (Everitt and Robbins, 2005). Several studies have shown that people with substance use disorders, and

Action-outcome learning in the pathophysiology of addiction
The traditional paradigms to investigate action-outcome associations in addiction have been the probabilistic reversal learning task, in which individuals must learn the value of a stimulus through trial-and-error, and the bandit task, in which participants sample from different choice options (bandits) that have unknown probabilities of winning and losing. More recently, innovative tasks have been developed to simultaneously characterise multiple learning strategies within the same individual

Leveraging new models of action-outcome learning to inform treatment and recovery
An impaired ability to engage with action selection policies that are likely to produce positive outcomes has obvious implications for the success of treatment programs for addiction. Recovery-oriented goals, such as securing employment and reconstructing family and social relationships, require a complex iterative series of action-outcome choices and related contingencies. Consumers enrolled in addiction treatment may face complex challenges to engage with these goals if they do not grasp the","Verdejo-Garcia, A; Chong, TT",2021,Decision-making; Addiction; Reinforcement learning; Goals; Neurocognitive mechanisms; Recovery,1036,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1016/j.pbb.2021.173275
Reduced neural differentiation of rewards and punishment during passive avoidance learning in adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder.,"It has been proposed that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) show dysfunctional computations related to approach-avoidance decision-making. However, few studies have examined the neural basis of this impairment, particularly in adolescents with GAD. The goal of the current study was to address this gap in the literature.

Method
The study involved 51 adolescents with GAD and 51 typically developing (TD) comparison individuals matched on age (16.10 and 15.75 respective means), gender (30_F/21_M and 24_F/27_M), and IQ (103.20 and 103.18 respective means). Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a passive avoidance task.

Results
We found a significant Group-by-Reinforcement interaction within reward-related brain regions including the caudate, putamen, mid cingulate/paracentral lobule, and superior and middle frontal gyrus. TD adolescents showed a greater differential response to reward versus punishment feedback within these regions relative to adolescents with GAD. In particular, this reflected reduced responses to rewards in the adolescents with GAD. There were no group differences in neural responses when making approach/avoidance responses.

Conclusion
The results of this study suggest reduced differential responsiveness to reinforcement as a component of the pathophysiology seen in adolescents with GAD. This dysfunction likely underpins decision-making impairments that may exacerbate the participants' worry.","Bashford‚ÄêLargo, J; Aloi, J; Zhang, R; Bajaj, S; Carollo, E; Elowsky, J; Schwartz, A; Dobbertin, M; Blair, RJR; Blair, KS",2021,fMRI; decision-making; neuroimaging; GAD; anxiety,1054,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1002/da.23150

Family history of depression is associated with alterations in task-dependent connectivity between the cerebellum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.,"A family history of major depressive disorder (MDD) increases the likelihood of a future depressive episode, which itself poses a significant risk for disruptions in reward processing and social cognition. However, it is unclear whether a family history of MDD is associated with alterations in the neural circuitry underlying reward processing and social cognition.

Methods
We subdivided 279 participants from the Human Connectome Project into three groups: 71 with a lifetime history of MDD, 103 with a family history (FH) of MDD, and 105 healthy controls (HCs). We then evaluated task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging data on a social cognition and a reward processing task and found a region of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) that responded to both tasks, independent of the group. To investigate whether the vmPFC shows alterations in functional connectivity between groups, we conducted psychophysiological interaction analyses using the vmPFC as a seed region.

Results
We found that FH (relative to HC) was associated with increased sadness scores, and MDD (relative to both FH and HC) was associated with increased sadness and MDD symptoms. Additionally, the FH group had increased vmPFC functional connectivity within the nucleus accumbens, left dorsolateral PFC, and subregions of the cerebellum relative to HC during the social cognition task.

Conclusions
These findings suggest that aberrant neural mechanisms among those with a familial risk of MDD may underlie vulnerability to altered social cognition.","Tepfer, LJ; Alloy, LB; Smith, DV",2021,fMRI; functional connectivity; family history; depression,1060,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1002/da.23143

[beta]-cells in youth with impaired glucose tolerance or early type 2 diabetes secrete more insulin and are more responsive than in adults.,"Glycemic control deteriorates more rapidly in youth vs adults. We compared model-derived measures of _-cell function between youth and adults with either impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes to determine if a _-cell defect differentiates these age groups.

Methods
This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Study. Youth (54 Y-IGT, 33 Y-D) and adults (250 A-IGT, 104 A-D) underwent 3-hour oral glucose tolerance tests for modeling of insulin secretion rates (ISRs), glucose sensitivity, and rate sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity was quantified as the glucose infusion rate/insulin (M/I) from a hyperglycemic clamp.

Results
Youth had lower insulin sensitivity despite similar body mass index. Analyses were adjusted for insulin sensitivity. Youth had higher basal ISRs (Y-IGT 200_±_161 vs A-IGT 152_±_74, P_<_.001; Y-D 245_±_2.5 vs A-D 168_±_115_pmol/min/m2, P = .007) and total ISRs (Y-IGT 124_±_86 vs A-IGT 98_±_39, P_<_.001; Y-D 116_±_110 vs A-D 97_±_62_nmol/m2, P = .002). Within IGT, glucose sensitivity (Y-IGT 140_±_153 vs A-IGT 112_±_70_pmol/min/m2/mM, P = .004) and rate sensitivity (median[interquartile range]:Y-IGT 2271[1611, 3222] vs A-IGT 1164[685, 1565] pmol/m2/mM, P_<_.001) were higher in youth, but not different by age group within diabetes.

Conclusions
Model-derived measures of _-cell function provide additional insight into the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in youth with higher ISRs and _-cell secretion more responsive to glucose in youth relative to adults even after adjusting for differences in insulin sensitivity. It is unknown whether these findings in youth reflect _-cells that are healthier or whether this is a defect that contributes to more rapid loss of function","Utzschneider, KM; Tripputi, MT; Kozedub, A; Mather, KJ; Nadeau, KJ; Edelstein, SL; Hannon, TS; Arslanian, SA; Cree‚ÄêGreen, M; Buchanan, TA; Caprio, S; Mari, A; The RISE Consortium",2020,type 2 diabetes; [beta]-cell function; insulin secretion; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin sensitivity,1079,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1111/pedi.13113
Volumes of the Hippocampal Formation Differentiate Component Processes of Memory in a Community Sample of Homeless and Marginally Housed Persons.,"Persons who are homeless or marginally housed exhibit significant cognitive dysfunction, with memory being the most impaired domain. Hippocampal subfield volumes have been found to differentially relate to component processes of memory. The neural correlates of memory have not been previously examined in marginalized persons who are understudied and underserved. We examined whether hippocampal subfields and entorhinal cortex volumes are uniquely related to indices of verbal episodic memory using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised.

Method
Data was used from a large sample of community dwelling homeless and marginally housed adults (N = 227). Regression analyses were conducted to examine hippocampal subfield volumes (CA1, CA3, CA4, dentate gyrus, subiculum) and entorhinal cortex, and their associations with measures of verbal immediate recall, learning slope, and verbal delayed recall.

Results
Greater CA3 subfield volume was associated with better performance on an index of encoding (immediate recall), but only in older individuals. Greater CA1 and subiculum volumes were associated with better performance on immediate and delayed recall (measures that tap into retrieval processes), but not with learning slope (a more pure index of encoding). Entorhinal cortex volume was related to all components of memory beyond total hippocampal volume.

Conclusions
Our results suggest common neuroanatomical correlates of memory dysfunction in large sample of marginalized persons, and these are uniquely related to different components of memory. These findings have clinical relevance for marginalized populations and theoretical relevance to the growing literature on functional specialization of the hippocampal subfields","Gicas, KM; Thornton, AE; Waclawik, K; Wang, N; Jones, AA; Panenka, WJ; Lang, DJ; Smith, GN; Vila-Rodriguez, F; Leonova, O; Barr, AM; Procyshyn, RM; Buchanan, T; Su, W; Vertinsky, AT; Rauscher, A; MacEwan, GW; Honer, WG",2019,Cognition; Memory; Hippocampus; Comorbidity; Neuroimaging,1115,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1093/arclin/acy066

"Associations of growth from birth to puberty with glycemic indicators at ~17.5 years: Evidence from Hong Kong's ""Children of 1997"" birth cohort.","From an evolutionary biology perspective, where growth and reproduction trade-off against longevity, we assessed the associations of growth from birth to puberty by phase with later glycemic indicators and any differences by sex.

Methods
In the population-representative Hong Kong Chinese “Children of 1997” birth cohort (n_=_8327), the relation of initial size (weight-for-age z score (WAZ) at birth, length/height-for-age z score (LAZ) at 3_months or body-mass-index-for-age z score (BAZ) at 3_months based on the World Health Organization growth standards/references) and growth at different phases (WAZ gains from 0 to 2 and 2 to 8_years, LAZ or BAZ gains from 3_months to 3_years, 3 to 8_years and 8 to 14 years) with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at ~17.5_years, was assessed using adjusted partial least squares regression. Additional analyses further considered growth in late and early infancy.

Results
This study included 3276 of the cohort participants. Higher WAZ gain from 2 to 8_years, LAZ and BAZ gains from 3 to 8_years were consistently associated with higher FPG, adjusted for maternal and infant characteristics, family history of diabetes and household income. Also, higher BAZ gain from 3 to 8_years was associated with higher HbA1c. These associations did not differ by sex.

Conclusions
Our findings suggest different mechanisms could underlie the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance. Factors that drive specific growth at different phases need to be evaluated to better inform child growth management for long-term health outcomes","Cheng, TS; Leung, GM; Hui, LL; Leung, JYY; Kwok, MK; Au Yeung, SL; Schooling, CM",2019,BMI; fasting plasma glucose; HbA1c; length/height; weight,1133,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1111/pedi.12838
Should We Control? The Interplay Between Cognitive Control and Information Integration in the Resolution of the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma.,"In their daily decisions, humans and animals are often confronted with the conflicting choice of opting either for a rewarding familiar option (i.e., exploitation) or for a novel, uncertain option that may, however, yield a better reward in the near future (i.e., exploration). Despite extensive research, the cognitive mechanisms that subtend the manner in which humans solve this exploration-exploitation dilemma are still poorly understood. In this study, we challenge the popular assumption that exploitation is a global default strategy that must be suppressed by means of cognitive control mechanisms so as to enable exploratory strategies. To do so, we asked participants to engage in a challenging working memory task while performing repeated choices in a gambling task. Results showed that manipulating cognitive control resources exclusively hindered participants’ ability to explore the environment in a directed, intentional manner. Moreover, under certain scenarios, adopting exploitative strategies was also dependent on the availability of cognitive control resources. Additional analyses using a recent computational model of information integration suggests that increasing cognitive load specifically interferes with the ability to combine reward and information in order to inform choices. Our results shed light on the cognitive mechanisms that underpin the resolution of the dilemma and provide a formal foundation through which to explore pathologies of goal-directed behavio","Cogliati Dezza, I; Cleeremans, A; Alexander, W",2019,cognitive control; reinforcement learning; adaptive behaviors; exploration-exploitation dilemma; informative value,1134,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/xge0000546

Debiasing of Gambling Beliefs and Behaviors Using a Digital Gambling Accelerator.,"Problem gamblers tend to adhere to rigid rules about the chances of winning and are resistant to counterfactual information. To promote a more accurate understanding of the odds of scratch-off ticket gambling, we created a brief debiasing intervention consisting of a digital gambling accelerator program that offers demonstrations of the long-term outcomes of gambling. Using a sample of nontreatment seeking scratch-off lottery gamblers recruited from the community (42 subclinical and 45 probable pathological gamblers), we compared the accelerator intervention to brief motivational interviewing (MI) and a control condition. Participants rated their chances of winning, urge to gamble, and readiness to change before and after the interventions. Self-reported dollar amount spent on scratch-off tickets and number of days gambled were assessed at baseline and again at 2- and 4-week follow-ups. Following the active interventions, gamblers in both conditions reported greater readiness to change than controls, and those in the accelerator condition also gave lower ratings of their chances of winning and urge to gamble. Marginal models showed participants in the accelerator condition gambled fewer days at the 2-week follow-up and spent less money at both the 2- and 4-week follow-ups compared to controls; no other between-subjects differences achieved statistical significance.

A Systematic Review of Interventions for Hot and Cold Executive Functions in Children and Adolescents With Acquired Brain Injury.,"We investigated interventions, which aimed to improve cold and hot executive functions (EFs) in children and adolescents with a diagnosis of acquired brain injury (ABI).

Methods
The following electronic databases were searched: Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Pubmed. The database filters limited the search to articles published between 1990 and July 2017 in English or Spanish, including children and adolescents. Articles were read and classified according to the levels of evidence of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and the Downs and Black checklist was used for Measuring Study Quality.

Results
Thirty studies are reported in this systematic review. Level of evidence, quality of the studies, characteristics of the participants, interventions implemented, and outcomes are described.

Conclusions
The study of rehabilitation for executive dysfunction in children with ABI is emerging. Although few high-quality intervention studies exist in this area, which limits conclusions regarding intervention efficacy, results of existing studies suggest that education for parents may be an important component of intervention. Moreover, caregiver involvement may improve the effectiveness of hot EFs rehabilitation interventions, while high intervention session frequency may be important in improving cold EFs. Positive behavior supports and specific training based on a cognitive model provided some promising findings, which require further evaluation","Chavez-Arana, C; Catroppa, C; Carranza-Esc√°rcega, E; Godfrey, C; Y√°√±ez-T√©llez, G; Prieto-Corona, B; de Le√≥n, MA; Anderson, V",2018,executive functions; adolescents; children; acquired brain injury; intervention; rehabilitation and systematic review,1158,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1093/jpepsy/jsy013
Catecholaminergic Modulation of the Avoidance of Cognitive Control.,"The catecholamines have long been associated with cognitive control and value-based decision-making. More recently, we proposed that the catecholamines might modulate value-based decision-making about whether or not to engage in cognitive control. We test this hypothesis by assessing effects of a catecholamine challenge in a large sample of young, healthy adults (n = 100) on the avoidance of a cognitively demanding control process: task switching. Prolonging catecholamine transmission by blocking reuptake with methylphenidate altered the avoidance, but not the execution of cognitive control. Crucially, these effects could be isolated by taking into account individual differences in trait impulsivity, so that participants with higher trait impulsivity became more avoidant of cognitive control, despite faster task performance. One implication of these findings is that performance-enhancing effects of methylphenidate may be accompanied by an undermining effect on the willingness to exert cognitive control. Taken together, these findings integrate hitherto segregated literatures on catecholamines’ roles in value-based learning/choice and cognitive control","Frob√∂se, MI; Swart, JC; Cook, JL; Geurts, DEM; den Ouden, HEM; Cools, R",2018,cognitive control; avoidance learning; cognitive effort; methylphenidate; task switching,1162,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/xge0000523

Intrinsic Whole Number Bias in Humans.,"Humans have great difficulty comparing quotients including fractions, proportions, and probabilities and often erroneously isolate the whole numbers of the numerators and denominators to compare them. Some have argued that the whole number bias is a compensatory strategy to deal with difficult comparisons. We examined adult humans’ preferences for gambles that differed only in numerosity, and not in factors that influence their expected value (probabilities and stakes). Subjects consistently preferred gambles with more winning balls to ones with fewer, even though the probabilities were mathematically identical, replicating prior results. In a second experiment, we found that subjects accurately represented the relative probabilities of the choice options during rapid nonverbal probability judgments but nonetheless showed biases based on whole numbers. We mathematically formalized and quantitatively evaluated cognitive rules based on existing hypotheses that attempt to explain subjects’ whole number biases during quotient comparisons. The results show that the whole number bias is intrinsic to the way humans solve quotient comparisons rather than a compensatory strategy","Alonso-D√≠az, S; Piantadosi, ST; Hayden, BY; Cantlon, JF",2018,Bayesian model; fraction; numerosity; probability; whole number bias,1172,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/xhp0000544

Consequences for Peers Differentially Bias Computations About Risk Across Development.,"Adolescents routinely take risks that impact the well-being of the friends they are with. However, it remains unclear when and how consequences for friends factor into decisions to take risks. Here we used an economic decision-making task to test whether risky choices are guided by the positive and negative consequences they promise for peers. Across a large developmental sample of participants ages 12–25, we show that risky decision computations increasingly assimilate friends’ outcomes throughout adolescence into early adulthood in an asymmetric manner that overemphasizes protecting friends from incurring loss. Whereas adults accommodated friend outcomes to a greater degree when the friend was present and witnessing these choices, adolescents did so regardless of whether a friend could witness their decisions, highlighting the fundamentality of adolescent social motivations. By demonstrating that outcomes for another individual can powerfully tune an actor’s risk tolerance, these results identify a key factor underlying peer-related motivations for risky behavior, with implications for the law and risk-prevention","Powers, KE; Yaffe, G; Hartley, CA; Davidow, JY; Kober, H; Somerville, LH",2018,decision-making; risk; development; adolescence; peer influence,1189,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/xge0000389
"Impaired fasting glucose and the metabolic profile in Danish children and adolescents with normal weight, overweight, or obesity.","Whether the definitions of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) differentially impact estimates of the metabolic profile and IFG-related comorbidities in Danish children and adolescents is unknown.

Methods
Two thousand one hundred and fifty four (979 boys) children and adolescents with overweight or obesity (median age 12 years) and 1824 (728 boys) children with normal weight (median age 12 years) from The Danish Childhood Obesity Biobank were studied. Anthropometrics, blood pressure, puberty, and fasting concentrations of glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and lipids were measured.

Results
About 14.1% of participants with overweight or obesity exhibited IFG according to the ADA and 3.5% according to the WHO definition. Among individuals with normal weight, the corresponding prevalences were 4.3% and 0.3%. IFG was associated with a higher systolic blood pressure, higher concentrations of HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide (P_<_.0001) and triglycerides (P_=_.03), and lower HOMA2-IS and HOMA2-B (P_<_.0001) independent of sex, age, puberty, waist-to-height ratio, and degree of obesity. Furthermore, IFG was associated with a higher risk for hypertension (OR_=_1.66 [95%CI: 1.21; 2.28], P_=_.002) and dyslipidemia (OR_=_1.90 [95%CI: 1.38; 2.56], P_<_.0001) compared with the group without IFG independent of age, sex, and puberty.

Conclusions
The prevalence of IFG, when applying the ADA criterion compared with the WHO criterion, was 4 times higher in individuals with overweight and obesity and 14 times higher in individuals with normal weight in this study sample of children and adolescents. IFG was associated with a higher risk of hypertension and dyslipidemia compared with their normoglycemic peers regardless of the definition applied","Kloppenborg, JT; Fonvig, CE; Nielsen, TRH; Mollerup, PM; B√∏js√∏e, C; Pedersen, O; Johannesen, J; Hansen, T; Holm, J",2018,obesity; children; glucose metabolism; impaired fasting glucose,1190,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1111/pedi.12604

Virtually 'in the heat of the moment': insula activation in safe sex negotiation among risky men.,"HIV is most prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM), and although most MSM use condoms consistently during casual sex, some take risks. To better understand the psychology of those risky decisions, we examined neural correlates of playing a virtual sexual ‘hook up’ game in an functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner in MSM who had, in the past 90_days, been sexually risky (N_=_76) or safe (N_=_31). We found that during potentially risky sexual choices, previously risky MSM had more right insula activity than previously safe MSM. Real-life sexual risk was related to trait positive and negative urgency. Insula activity that differentiated risky and safe MSM was related to trait positive and negative urgency. Future work should further examine if, and to what extent, insula activation during safe sex negotiation drives MSM’s rash risky sexual decision-making.","Smith, BJ; Xue, F; Droutman, V; Barkley-Levenson, E; Melrose, AJ; Miller, LC; Monterosso, JR; Bechara, A; Appleby, PR; Christensen, JL; Godoy, CG; Read, SJ",2018,fMRI; insula; men who have sex with men; negative urgency; risky decision-making; sexual health,1200,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1093/scan/nsx137
"Suboptimal Choice, Reward-Predictive Signals, and Temporal Information.","Suboptimal choice refers to preference for an alternative offering a low probability of food (suboptimal alternative) over an alternative offering a higher probability of food (optimal alternative). Numerous studies have found that stimuli signaling probabilistic food play a critical role in the development and maintenance of suboptimal choice. However, there is still much debate about how to characterize how these stimuli influence suboptimal choice. There is substantial evidence that the temporal information conveyed by a food-predictive signal governs its function as both a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus and as an instrumental conditioned reinforcer. Thus, we explore the possibility that food-predictive signals influence suboptimal choice via the temporal information they convey. Application of this temporal information-theoretic approach to suboptimal choice provides a formal, quantitative framework that describes how food-predictive signals influence suboptimal choice in a manner consistent with related phenomena in Pavlovian conditioning and conditioned reinforcement. Our reanalysis of previous data on suboptimal choice suggests that, generally speaking, preference in the suboptimal choice procedure tracks relative temporal information conveyed by food-predictive signals for the suboptimal and optimal alternatives. The model suggests that suboptimal choice develops when the food-predictive signal for the suboptimal alternative conveys more temporal information than that for the optimal alternative. Finally, incorporating a role for competition between temporal information provided by food-predictive signals and relative primary reinforcement rate provides a reasonable account of existing data on suboptimal choice","Cunningham, PJ; Shahan, TA",2018,conditioned reinforcement; suboptimal choice; information theory; temporal information; Pavlovian conditioning,1205,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/xan0000160

Emotion and the Prefrontal Cortex: An Integrative Review.,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in the generation and regulation of emotion. However, we lack an integrative framework for understanding how different emotion-related functions are organized across the entire expanse of the PFC, as prior reviews have generally focused on specific emotional processes (e.g., decision making) or specific anatomical regions (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex). Additionally, psychological theories and neuroscientific investigations have proceeded largely independently because of the lack of a common framework. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological, lesion, and structural connectivity studies on the emotion-related functions of 8 subregions spanning the entire PFC. We introduce the appraisal-by-content model, which provides a new framework for integrating the diverse range of empirical findings. Within this framework, appraisal serves as a unifying principle for understanding the PFC’s role in emotion, while relative content-specialization serves as a differentiating principle for understanding the role of each subregion. A synthesis of data from affective, social, and cognitive neuroscience studies suggests that different PFC subregions are preferentially involved in assigning value to specific types of inputs: exteroceptive sensations, episodic memories and imagined future events, viscero-sensory signals, viscero-motor signals, actions, others’ mental states (e.g., intentions), self-related information, and ongoing emotions. We discuss the implications of this integrative framework for understanding emotion regulation, value-based decision making, emotional salience, and refining theoretical models of emotion. This framework provides a unified understanding of how emotional processes are organized across PFC subregions and generates new hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying adaptive and maladaptive emotional functioning","Dixon, ML; Thiruchselvam, R; Todd, R; Christoff, K",2017,decision making; emotion; prefrontal cortex; value; ventromedial,1216,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/bul0000096
Beyond Happiness: Building a Science of Discrete Positive Emotions.,"While trait positive emotionality and state positive-valence affect have long been the subject of intense study, the importance of differentiating among several “discrete” positive emotions has only recently begun to receive serious attention. In this article, we synthesize existing literature on positive emotion differentiation, proposing that the positive emotions are best described as branches of a “family tree” emerging from a common ancestor mediating adaptive management of fitness-critical resources (e.g., food). Examples are presented of research indicating the importance of differentiating several positive emotion constructs. We then offer a new theoretical framework, built upon a foundation of phylogenetic, neuroscience, and behavioral evidence, that accounts for core features as well as mechanisms for differentiation. We propose several directions for future research suggested by this framework and develop implications for the application of positive emotion research to translational issues in clinical psychology and the science of behavior change","Shiota, MN; Campos, B; Oveis, C; Hertenstein, MJ; Simon-Thomas, E; Keltner, D",2017,reward; dopamine; discrete emotions; evolution; positive emotion,1220,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/a0040456
Decisions to Attend and Drink at Party Events: The Effects of Incentives and Disincentives and Lifetime Alcohol and Antisocial Problems.,"Alcohol use disorders are associated with patterns of impulsive/risky decision making on behavioral economic decision tasks, but little is known about the factors affecting drinking-related decisions.

Methods
The effects of incentives and disincentives to attend and drink at hypothetical alcohol-related party events as a function of lifetime (LT) alcohol and antisocial problems were examined in a sample of 434 young adults who varied widely in LT alcohol and antisocial problems.

Results
Moderate and high disincentives substantially discouraged decisions to attend the party events and were associated with decisions to drink less at the party events. High versus low party incentives were associated with more attendance decisions. LT antisocial problems were associated with being less deterred from attending by moderate and high disincentives. LT alcohol problems were associated with greater attendance at high party incentive contexts. LT alcohol problems were associated with drinking more at the majority of events; however, the results indicate that young adults with high levels of alcohol problems moderate their drinking in response to moderate and high disincentives. Finally, attendance and drinking decisions on this hypothetical task were significantly related to actual drinking practices.

Conclusions
The results suggest that antisocial symptoms are associated with a reduced sensitivity to the potential negative consequences of drinking, while alcohol problems are associated with a greater sensitivity to the rewarding aspects of partying. The results also underline the value of directly assessing drinking-related decisions in different hypothetical contexts as well as assessing decisions about attendance at risky drinking events in addition to drinking amount decisions","Finn, PR; Gerst, K; Lake, A; Bogg, T",2017,Drinking; Alcohol Problems; Antisocial Problems; Decision-Making,1222,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1111/acer.13443
Identifying new susceptibility genes on dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways for the framing effect in decision-making.,"The framing effect refers the tendency to be risk-averse when options are presented positively but be risk-seeking when the same options are presented negatively during decision-making. This effect has been found to be modulated by the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) and the catechol-o-methyltransferase gene (COMT) polymorphisms, which are on the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways and which are associated with affective processing. The current study aimed to identify new genetic variations of genes on dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways that may contribute to individual differences in the susceptibility to framing. Using genome-wide association data and the gene-based principal components regression method, we examined genetic variations of 26 genes on the pathways in 1317 Chinese Han participants. Consistent with previous studies, we found that the genetic variations of the SLC6A4 gene and the COMT gene were associated with the framing effect. More importantly, we demonstrated that the genetic variations of the aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (DDC) gene, which is involved in the synthesis of both dopamine and serotonin, contributed to individual differences in the susceptibility to framing. Our findings shed light on the understanding of the genetic basis of affective decision-making","Gao, X; Liu, J; Gong, P; Wang, J; Fang, W; Yan, H; Zhu, L; Zhou, X",2017,decision-making; GWAS; COMT; DDC; framing effect; SLC6A4,1223,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1093/scan/nsx062
Attributes of Conscientiousness Throughout the Animal Kingdom: An Empirical and Evolutionary Overview.,"Conscientiousness is a fundamental aspect of human personality, one that is closely linked with various favorable life outcomes. Despite its importance in humans, conscientiousness has received little attention as to how it may have evolved, or whether it provides similar fitness benefits in other animals. To date, research in animal personality has found consistent support for the presence of all major dimensions of human personality in other animals except conscientiousness. In this review, we investigate conscientiousness at the level of traits and facets (clusters of closely related traits). A systematic review of the literature retrieved 876 relevant publications describing attributes of conscientiousness in other animal species. A factor analysis of citation counts revealed 2 major dimensions representing 9 distinct facets of conscientiousness in nonhumans. These facets, together with their underlying personality traits, exhibit individual variability, are generally known to be heritable, and often offer clear fitness benefits to individuals. Other facets of conscientiousness appear to be unique to humans. Publication biases, research biases, and anthropomorphism may all play a role in the structure of the evidence we report. We conclude by suggesting fruitful areas of future research to further elucidate the presence and functional roles of conscientiousness in animals","Delgado, MM; Sulloway, FJ",2017,evolution; animal personality; behavioral syndromes; conscientiousness; Five Factor Model,1227,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/bul0000107

A Transdiagnostic Review of Negative Symptom Phenomenology and Etiology.,"In the DSM5, negative symptoms are 1 of the 5 core dimensions of psychopathology evaluated for schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not pathognomonic—they are also part of the diagnostic criteria for other schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, disorders that sometimes have comorbid psychosis, diagnoses not in the schizophrenia-spectrum, and the general “nonclinical” population. Although etiological models of negative symptoms have been developed for chronic schizophrenia, there has been little attention given to whether these models have transdiagnostic applicability. In the current review, we examine areas of commonality and divergence in the clinical presentation and etiology of negative symptoms across diagnostic categories. It was concluded that negative symptoms are relatively frequent across diagnostic categories, but individual disorders may differ in whether their negative symptoms are persistent/transient or primary/secondary. Evidence for separate dimensions of volitional and expressive symptoms exists, and there may be multiple mechanistic pathways to the same symptom phenomenon among DSM-5 disorders within and outside the schizophrenia-spectrum (ie, equifinality). Evidence for a novel transdiagnostic etiological model is presented based on the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs, which proposes the existence of 2 such pathways—a hedonic pathway and a cognitive pathway—that can both lead to expressive or volitional symptoms. To facilitate treatment breakthroughs, future transdiagnostic studies on negative symptoms are warranted that explore mechanisms underlying volitional and expressive pathology.","Strauss, GP; Cohen, AS",2017,alogia; anhedonia; asociality; avolition; blunted affect,1229,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1093/schbul/sbx066

"Effects of Alcohol, Initial Gambling Outcomes, Impulsivity, and Gambling Cognitions on Gambling Behavior Using a Video Poker Task.","Drinking and gambling frequently co-occur, and concurrent gambling and drinking may lead to greater negative consequences than either behavior alone. Building on prior research on the effects of alcohol, initial gambling outcomes, impulsivity, and gambling cognitions on gambling behaviors using a chance-based (nonstrategic) slot-machine task, the current study explored the impact of these factors on a skill-based (strategic) video poker task. We anticipated larger average bets and greater gambling persistence under alcohol relative to placebo, and expected alcohol effects to be moderated by initial gambling outcomes, impulsivity, and gambling cognitions. Participants (N = 162; 25.9% female) were randomly assigned to alcohol (target BrAC = .08g%) or placebo and were given $10 to wager on a simulated video poker task, which was programmed to produce 1 of 3 initial outcomes (win, breakeven, or lose) before beginning a progressive loss schedule. Despite evidence for validity of the video poker task and alcohol administration paradigm, primary hypotheses were not supported. Individuals who received alcohol placed smaller wagers than participants in the placebo condition, though this effect was not statistically significant, and the direction of effects was reversed in at-risk gamblers (n = 41). These findings contradict prior research and suggest that alcohol effects on gambling behavior may differ by gambling type (nonstrategic vs. strategic games). Interventions that suggest alcohol is universally disinhibiting may be at odds with young adults’ lived experience and thus be less effective than those that recognize the greater complexity of alcohol effects","Corbin, WR; Cronce, JM",2017,alcohol; impulsivity; gambling; cognitions; persistence,1236,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/pha0000125
Neural Outcome Processing of Peer-Influenced Risk-Taking Behavior in Late Adolescence: Preliminary Evidence for Gene x Environment Interactions.,"Adolescent brains are particularly susceptible to the rewarding properties of risky decisions in social contexts. Individual differences in genetic influences on dopamine transmission moderate neural outcome processing of risky decisions and may exert pronounced effects on adolescent risk-taking behavior (RTB) and corresponding neural outcome processing in peer contexts, a process called gene-environment interaction (G _ E). Eighty-five undergraduate students completed a behavioral risk task alone and in the presence of a confederate peer providing “risky” feedback. We tested for G _ E effects using a polygenic risk index that included 3 candidate genetic variations associated with high dopamine transmission efficiency, as well as the moderating role of family history of behavioral disinhibition. Difference waves for the P300 and FRN (i.e., feedback-related negativity) were examined as indices of neural outcome processing. A G _ E effect was observed for RTB and the P300, but not the FRN. Family history of behavioral disinhibition also interacted with peer influence to predict P300 amplitude. These data provide preliminary evidence for G _ E for peer-influenced RTB and neural outcome processing during late adolescence. Genetic influences on dopaminergic function may be particularly relevant for attentional and motivational neural systems, as indexed by the P300, which exert downstream effects on peer-influenced RTB.","Webber, TA; Soder, HE; Potts, GF; Park, JY; Bornovalova, MA",2017,P300; peer influence; risk-taking behavior; dopamine genetics; FRN,1245,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/pha0000105
The theory of constructed emotion: an active inference account of interoception and categorization.,"The science of emotion has been using folk psychology categories derived from philosophy to search for the brain basis of emotion. The last two decades of neuroscience research have brought us to the brink of a paradigm shift in understanding the workings of the brain, however, setting the stage to revolutionize our understanding of what emotions are and how they work. In this article, we begin with the structure and function of the brain, and from there deduce what the biological basis of emotions might be. The answer is a brain-based, computational account called the theory of constructed emotion.","Barrett, LF",2017,emotion; concepts; affect; categorization; construction; interoception; predictive coding,1253,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1093/scan/nsw154

"Searching for the Best Cause: Roles of Mechanism Beliefs, Autocorrelation, and Exploitation.","When testing which of multiple causes (e.g., medicines) works best, the testing sequence has important implications for the validity of the final judgment. Trying each cause for a period of time before switching to the other is important if the causes have tolerance, sensitization, delay, or carryover (TSDC) effects. In contrast, if the outcome variable is autocorrelated and gradually fluctuates over time rather than being random across time, it can be useful to quickly alternate between the 2 causes, otherwise the causes could be confounded with a secular trend in the outcome. Five experiments tested whether individuals modify their causal testing strategies based on beliefs about TSDC effects and autocorrelation in the outcome. Participants adaptively tested each cause for longer periods of time before switching when testing causal interventions for which TSDC effects were plausible relative to cases when TSDC effects were not plausible. When the autocorrelation in the baseline trend was manipulated, participants exhibited only a small (if any) tendency toward increasing the amount of alternation; however, they adapted to the autocorrelation by focusing on changes in outcomes rather than raw outcome scores, both when making choices about which cause to test as well as when making the final judgment of which cause worked best. Understanding how people test causal relations in diverse environments is an important first step for being able to predict when individuals will successfully choose effective causes in real-world settings","Rottman, BM",2016,causal reasoning; dynamic environments; information search; win-stay lose-switch,1273,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/xlm0000244
Reduced Model-Based Decision-Making in Schizophrenia.,"Individuals with schizophrenia have a diminished ability to use reward history to adaptively guide behavior. However, tasks traditionally used to assess such deficits often rely on multiple cognitive and neural processes, leaving etiology unresolved. In the current study, we adopted recent computational formalisms of reinforcement learning to distinguish between model-based and model-free decision-making in hopes of specifying mechanisms associated with reinforcement-learning dysfunction in schizophrenia. Under this framework, decision-making is model-free to the extent that it relies solely on prior reward history, and model-based if it relies on prospective information such as motivational state, future consequences, and the likelihood of obtaining various outcomes. Model-based and model-free decision-making was assessed in 33 schizophrenia patients and 30 controls using a 2-stage 2-alternative forced choice task previously demonstrated to discern individual differences in reliance on the 2 forms of reinforcement-learning. We show that, compared with controls, schizophrenia patients demonstrate decreased reliance on model-based decision-making. Further, parameter estimates of model-based behavior correlate positively with IQ and working memory measures, suggesting that model-based deficits seen in schizophrenia may be partially explained by higher-order cognitive deficits. These findings demonstrate specific reinforcement-learning and decision-making deficits and thereby provide valuable insights for understanding disordered behavior in schizophrenia","Culbreth, AJ; Westbrook, A; Daw, ND; Botvinick, M; Barch, DM",2016,decision-making; computational modeling; schizophrenia; model-based learning,1274,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/abn0000164

Neurocognitive Performance in Unmedicated Patients With Hoarding Disorder.,"Hoarding disorder (HD) is an often incapacitating psychiatric illness associated with a wide range of neurocognitive abnormalities. Some prior neuropsychological studies have found executive dysfunction in HD, but no clear pattern has emerged. One potential reason for discrepant results in previous studies might be the inclusion of patients on psychotropic and other medications that can affect neurocognitive performance. Therefore, we examined neurocognitive functioning in medication-free HD patients. We also added a novel investigation of implicit learning, which has been found to be abnormal in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and related disorders. Method: Twenty-six participants meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM–5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) diagnostic criteria for HD and 23 normal controls were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests and symptom rating scales. All participants were free of psychotropic medications for at least 6 weeks prior to the study. Results: HD participants showed no significant differences from normal controls on measures of verbal memory, attention, or executive functioning, including response inhibition, planning, organization, and decision making. However, HD participants demonstrated a trend toward less implicit learning and greater use of explicit learning strategies during perceptual categorization compared to normal controls. HD participants who used an implicit strategy performed significantly worse than controls who used an implicit strategy. Hoarding symptom severity was not associated with neurocognitive performance. Conclusions: HD patients may have a tendency to use explicit rather than implicit learning strategies for perceptual categorization but perform as well as normal controls on many other neurocognitive measures. Future studies should assess unmedicated participants and examine test strategies, not just outcomes","Sumner, JM; Noack, CG; Filoteo, JV; Maddox, WT; Saxena, S",2016,neurocognitive; compulsive; hoarding; implicit; unmedicated,1295,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/neu0000234
"The Assessment of Risky Decision Making: A Factor Analysis of Performance on the Iowa Gambling Task, Balloon Analogue Risk Task, and Columbia Card Task.","Researchers and clinicians frequently use behavioral measures to assess decision making. The most common task that is marketed to clinicians is the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), thought to assess risky decision making. How does performance on the IGT relate to performance on other common measures of decision making? The present study sought to examine relationships between the IGT, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), and the Columbia Card Task (CCT). Participants were 390 undergraduate students who completed the IGT, BART, and either the “hot” or “cold” CCT. Principal components factor analysis on the IGT, BART, and CCT-cold (n = 112) indicated that the IGT measures a different component of decision making than the BART, and the CCT-cold weakly correlated with early IGT trials. Results of the exploratory factor analysis on the IGT, BART, and CCT-hot (n = 108) revealed a similar picture: the IGT and BART assessed different types of decision making, and the BART and CCT-hot were weakly correlated. A confirmatory factor analysis (n = 170) indicated that a 3-factor model without the CCT-cold (Factor 1: later IGT trials; Factor 2: BART; and Factor 3: early IGT trials) was a better fitting model than one that included the CCT-cold and early IGT trials on the same factor. Collectively, the present results suggest that the IGT, BART, and CCT all measure unique, nonoverlapping decision making processes. Further research is needed to more fully understand the neuropsychological construct of decision making","Buelow, MT; Blaine, AL",2015,Iowa Gambling Task; Balloon Analogue Risk Task; Columbia Card Task; risky decision making,1315,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1037/a0038622

EMOTION EXPLAINED.,"BOOK REVIEW: Emotion has become a well-represented, and well-respected, topic of neuroscientific inquiry, as borne out by its exponential increase in citation indices (e.g. increases in publications with the word in their title by 300 in the 1980s, by 900 in the 1990s and by >1600 in the past 6 years according to Science Citation Index). The reasons for this increase lie with advances both in our theoretical understanding of emotions and in the development of new tools for exploring their neural basis—notably functional neuroimaging. These efforts have resulted in important advances also in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases, many of which feature dysfunctional emotions as one of the most disabling components. It is thus timely to take stock of what we have learned, and to publish books that summarize the state of the field.","Ralph, A",2006,,1631,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1093/brain/awl227

Neural Modulation in Approach-Avoidance Conflicts in Externalizing Psychopathology.,"Externalizing psychopathology (EXT) is characterized by poor decision-making in situations that involve simultaneous cues for approach and avoidance behavior (i.e. approach-avoidance conflicts). Previous studies of EXT have examined these deficits primarily using tasks involving decisions between positive reward and negative punishment, suggesting that EXT is characterized by a general bias towards high salience (e.g. temporally proximal or reward) cues relative to low salience (e.g. temporally distal or loss) cues. However, in order to better characterize decision-making in approach-avoidance conflicts, the present study utilized a novel task to examine neural activation in contexts involving both positive reward and negative punishment as well as positive punishment and negative reward by manipulating physical proximity of affective cues. Neuroimaging results indicated that EXT was associated with deficits related to cue prioritization based on salience, suggesting that failure to differentiate relevant from less relevant information contributes to poor decision-making among individuals with EXT.","Lake, AJ; Finn, PR; James, TW",2021,Externalizing psychopathology; Decision making; Emotion; Motivation,1893,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1007/s11682-020-00308-4
Basal ganglia lateralization in different types of reward.,"Reward processing is a fundamental human activity. The basal ganglia are recognized for their role in reward processes; however, specific roles of the different nuclei (e.g., nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus) remain unclear. Using quantitative meta-analyses we assessed whole-brain and basal ganglia specific contributions to money, erotic, and food reward processing. We analyzed data from 190 fMRI studies which reported stereotaxic coordinates of whole-brain, within-group results from healthy adult participants. Results showed concordance in overlapping and distinct cortical and sub-cortical brain regions as a function of reward type. Common to all reward types was concordance in basal ganglia nuclei, with distinct differences in hemispheric dominance and spatial extent in response to the different reward types. Food reward processing favored the right hemisphere; erotic rewards favored the right lateral globus pallidus and left caudate body. Money rewards engaged the basal ganglia bilaterally including its most anterior part, nucleus accumbens. We conclude by proposing a model of common reward processing in the basal ganglia and separate models for money, erotic, and food rewards","Arsalidou, M; Vijayarajah, S; Sharaev, M",2020,Rewards; fMRI; Meta-analyses; Striatum; Basal ganglia,1916,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1007/s11682-019-00215-3

Editorial: bridging the gap with computational and translational psychopharmacology.,"The application of theoretical and computational approaches to the analysis of complex behavior has a rich history in psychology. A shining example of this is the modeling of learning encapsulated elegantly by Rescorla and Wagner (1972), who demonstrated that classical conditioning can be described by a simple mathematical equation. The explanatory power of the Rescorla-Wagner rule and its subsequent expansion into additional areas of behavioral plasticity has enabled the precise mapping of learning parameters onto neural structures and even individual neurons. A plethora of other mathematical models have since been used to describe a variety of behaviors, and to map those behaviors onto their underlying neurobiology. This so-called computational phenotyping is now gaining momentum as a translational tool that can be used to identify process characteristics in both humans and animals with the potential of transforming the field of psychopharmacology. The contributions to this Special Issue on Computational and Translational Psychopharmacology stem from the European Behavioural Pharmacology Society (EBPS) Workshop that was held at the University of Cambridge, in August of 2018. The overarching goal of the workshop was to foster discussion around the nascent subfield we refer to as Computational and Translational Psychopharmacology, and to identify points of convergence for which computational approaches could be used to enhance the translational value of animal and human studies. The manuscripts contained herein demonstrate the potential utility of such approaches and provide a foundation for continuous growth towards a better mechanistic understanding of the complex behaviors that characterize psychiatric conditions and the development of more predictive translational probes.","Flagel, SB; Gordon, JA; Paulus, MP",2019,DOPAMINE receptors; DOPAMINERGIC neurons; PARTIALLY observable Markov decision processes; PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,1963,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1007/s00213-019-05320-1

Alogliptin benzoate for management of type 2 diabetes.,"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, a new class of oral hypoglycemic agents, augment glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppress glucagon levels through enhancement of the action of endogenous incretin by inhibiting DPP-4, an incretin-degrading enzyme. DPP-4 inhibitors are generally well tolerated because of their low risk of hypoglycemia and other adverse events. Moreover, with their potential to improve beta cell function, a core defect of type 2 diabetes, DPP-4 inhibitors are becoming a major component of treatment of type 2 diabetes. Alogliptin benzoate is a newly developed, highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor which has been approved in many countries throughout the world. Once-daily administration of alogliptin as either monotherapy or combination therapy with other oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin has a potent glucose-lowering effect which is similar to that of other DPP-4 inhibitors, with a low risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. The cardiovascular safety of this drug has been confirmed in a recent randomized controlled trial. This review summarizes the efficacy and safety of alogliptin, and discusses the role of DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.","Saisho, Y",2015,"dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, type 2 diabetes, efficacy, safety, alogliptin",2111,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.2147/VHRM.S68564
Competing neurobehavioral decision systems and the neuroeconomics of craving in opioid addiction.,"Craving is typically thought of as a classically conditioned response characterized by an elevated mesolimbic dopamine response to drug-related stimuli. Although this definition has spurred considerable research, the clinical impact of the research conducted has been less robust. The current review takes a more contemporary approach by conceptualizing craving as the breakdown of executive function and relative strengthening of the limbic system, occurring in the presence of conditioned cues, leading to a maladaptive craving response (ie, an increased likelihood of drug consumption). Working from this framework, the present review focuses on four issues in drug craving research: pivotal findings and limitations of cue-reactivity and neurocognitive tasks; two main processes of craving that include self-control and reward-based explanations; integration of neuroeconomic approaches to craving; and the theoretical implications and future directions of drug craving research.","Jarmolowicz, DP; Sofis, M; Martin, L",2014,"craving, competing decision systems, executive function, loss of control, substance abuse",2130,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.2147/NAN.S38866

Molecular Nutrition Research-The Modern Way Of Performing Nutritional Science.,"In spite of amazing progress in food supply and nutritional science, and a striking increase in life expectancy of approximately 2.5 months per year in many countries during the previous 150 years, modern nutritional research has a great potential of still contributing to improved health for future generations, granted that the revolutions in molecular and systems technologies are applied to nutritional questions. Descriptive and mechanistic studies using state of the art epidemiology, food intake registration, genomics with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, advanced biostatistics, imaging, calorimetry, cell biology, challenge tests (meals, exercise, etc.), and integration of all data by systems biology, will provide insight on a much higher level than today in a field we may name molecular nutrition research. To take advantage of all the new technologies scientists should develop international collaboration and gather data in large open access databases like the suggested Nutritional Phenotype database (dbNP). This collaboration will promote standardization of procedures (SOP), and provide a possibility to use collected data in future research projects. The ultimate goals of future nutritional research are to understand the detailed mechanisms of action for how nutrients/foods interact with the body and thereby enhance health and treat diet-related diseases.","Norheim, F; Gjelstad, I; Hjorth, M; Vinknes, K; Langleite, T; Holen, T; Jensen, J; Dalen, K; Karlsen, A; Kielland, A; Rustan, A; Drevon, C",2012,"Genomics; Glucose Tolerance Test; Diet; Nutrition; Metabolism; Adipose Tissue; Cell Physiology; Exercise Test; Life Expectancy; Liver; Muscles; Polymorphism, Genetic; Proteomics; Research, Medical -- Trends",2192,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.3390/nu4121898

Reflection impulsivity in adolescent cannabis users: a comparison with alcohol-using and non-substance-using adolescents.,"Reflection impulsivity—a failure to gather and evaluate information before making a decision—is a critical component of risk-taking and substance use behaviours, which are highly prevalent during adolescence.

Objectives and methods
The Information Sampling Test was used to assess reflection impulsivity in 175 adolescents (mean age 18.3, range 16.5–20; 55% female)—48 cannabis users (2.3 years use, 10.8 days/month), 65 alcohol users, and 62 non-substance-using controls—recruited from a longitudinal cohort and from the general community and matched for education and IQ. Cannabis and alcohol users were matched on levels of alcohol consumption.

Results
Cannabis users sampled to the lowest degree of certainty before making a decision on the task. Group differences remained significant after controlling for relevant substance use and clinical confounds (e.g., anxiety, depressive symptoms, alcohol, and ecstasy use). Poor performance on multiple IST indices was associated with an earlier age of onset of regular cannabis use and greater duration of exposure to cannabis, after controlling for recent use. Alcohol users did not differ from controls on any IST measure.

Conclusions
Exposure to cannabis during adolescence is associated with increased risky and impulsive decision making, with users adopting strategies with higher levels of uncertainty and inefficient utilisation of information. The young cannabis users did show sensitivity to losses, suggesting that greater impulsivity early in their drug using career is more evident when there is a lack of negative consequences. This provides a window of opportunity for intervention before the onset of cannabis dependence.","Solowij, N; Jones, KA; Rozman, ME; Davis, SM; Ciarrochi, J; Heaven, PC; Pesa, N; Lubman, DI; Y√ºcel, M",2012,Decision making; Cannabis; Adolescence; Alcohol; Reflection impulsivity,2216,manual,FALSE,FALSE,U,10.1007/s00213-011-2486-y

Effect of Rosiglitazone and Metformin on Insulin Resistance in Patients Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Receiving Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy Containing Protease Inhibitor: Randomized Prospective Controlled Clinical Trial.,"To evaluate and compare effects of 48-week treatment with rosiglitazone and metformin on insulin resistance in patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), containing a protease inhibitor.

Methods
Randomized prospective controlled clinical trial enrolled 90 male patients infected with HIV and having impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance (fasting insulin concentration >20 mIU/L). The patients were randomly assigned into three groups (each 30 patients); the first group receiving 4 mg rosiglitazone once a day, the second group receiving 500 mg metformin two times a day, and the third group serving as control without hypoglycemic treatment. The primary efficacy parameters were fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels compared between baseline and week. Data on insulin resistance and beta cell function were analyzed by the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA).

Results
After 48 weeks of treatment, the fasting insulin concentration (±standard deviation) in rosiglitazone group significantly declined from 39.0_±_3.35 to 19.7_±_3.99 mIU/L (P<0.001; 49% decrease) and in metformin group from 40.3_±_2.29 to 29.2_±_2.82 mIU/L (P<0.001; 27% decrease). HOMA indicated that rosiglitazone significantly reduced insulin resistance from 11.3_±_1.03 to 4.0_±_0.95 (P<0.001), compared with metformin which reduced it from 11.9_±_0.73 to 5.7_±_0.62 (P<0.001). Insulin resistance was significantly lower in the rosiglitazone group after 48 weeks (P<0.001). Metformin significantly improved beta cell function (from 257.3_±_21.91 to 707.4_±_207.32; P<0.001), as did rosiglitazone (from 261.3_±_27.98 to 403.3_±_162.50; P<0.001), but the improvement in the metformin group was significantly better (P<0.001). However, metformin was more efficient in improving beta cell function (from 257.3_±_21.91 to 707.4_±_207.32) than rosiglitazone (from 261.3_±_27.98 to 403.3_±_162.50) .

Conclusions
Both rosiglitazone and metformin were effective and well tolerated in HIV patients, treated with protease inhibitor-containing HAART. Rosiglitazone significantly more reduced insulin resistance, while beta cell function was significantly better in patients on metformin. Both drugs may be considered as an appropriate therapy, with rosiglitazone being a better alternative in treating insulin resistance in this patient population","Siliƒç, A; Jane≈æ, A; Toma≈æiƒç, J; Karner, P; Vidmar, L; Sharma, P; Matiƒçiƒç, M",2007,,2311,manual,TRUE,FALSE,U,10.3325/cmj.2007.6.791
