While prospect utility-based modeling has shown to differentiate decision-making patterns between users of different drugs, its relevance in the context of treatment has yet to be examined. This study investigated model-based decision-making as it relates to treatment outcome in inpatients with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders., METHODS: 50 patients (Mage = 38.5, SD = 11.4; 16F) completed the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) within 2 weeks of admission (baseline) and 6 months into treatment (follow-up), and 50 controls (Mage = 31.9, SD = 10.0; 25F) completed CGT under a single outpatient session. We evaluated 4 traditional CGT outputs and 5 decisional processes derived from the Cumulative Model. Psychiatric diagnoses and discharge data were retrieved from patient health records., RESULTS: Groups were similar in age, sex, and premorbid IQ. Differences in years of education were included as covariates across all group comparisons. All patients had >=1 mental health diagnosis, with 80% having >1 substance use disorder. On the CGT, patients showed greater Deliberation Time and Delay Aversion than controls. Estimated model parameters revealed higher Delayed Reward Discounting, and lower Probability Distortion and Loss Sensitivity in patients relative to controls. From baseline to follow-up, patients (n = 24) showed a decrease in model-derived Loss Sensitivity and Color Choice Bias. Lastly, poorer Quality of Decision-Making and Choice Consistency, and greater Color Choice Bias independently predicted higher likelihood of treatment dropout, while none were significant in relation to treatment length of stay., CONCLUSION: This is the first study to assess a computational model of decision-making in the context of treatment for concurrent disorders. Patients were more impulsive and slower to deliberate choice than controls. While both traditional and computational outcomes predicted treatment adherence in patients, findings suggest computational methods are able to capture treatment-sensitive aspects of decision-making not accessible via traditional methods. Further research is needed to confirm findings as well as investigate the relationship between model-based decision-making and post-treatment outcomes.

This approach can be used to assess whether 2 tasks measure the same dimensions of cognition, or actually improve the estimates of cognitive models when there are overlapping cognitive processes between 2 related tasks. The approach is then applied to connecting decision data on 2 behavioral tasks that evaluate clinically relevant deficits, the delay discounting task and Cambridge gambling task, to determine whether they both measure the same dimension of impulsivity. We find that the discounting rate parameters in the models of each task are not closely related, although substance users exhibit more impulsive behavior on both tasks. Instead, temporal discounting on the delay discounting task as quantified by the model is more closely related to externalizing psychopathology like aggression, while temporal discounting on the Cambridge gambling task is related more to response inhibition failures. The methods we develop thus provide a new way to connect behavior across tasks and grant new insights onto the different dimensions of impulsivity and their relation to substance use.

(PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Translational Abstract-A key issue in understanding problems like addiction is identifying what psychological processes contribute to the initiation and continuation of substance use, such as inhibiting desires for immediate rewards (drugs) in favor of long-term goals (sobriety). The better we can quantify these processes using experimental tasks and models of behavior, the better we can predict and eventually prevent substance use. In this article, we develop methods for connecting behavior across different tasks and test whether two different experimental paradigms are measuring the same psychological processes. We show that this method can allow us to get more information about an individual and their propensity for substance use by combining data from two tasks, the delay discounting task and the Cambridge gambling task. When applied to these tasks, our approached showed that both tasks are predictive of substance use in heroin-, amphetamine-, and multiple-substance-dependent individuals. However, the two tasks appear to be measuring different dimensions or subtypes of impulsivity: The delay discounting task measures choice impulsivity, which is related to self-report measures of substance use and propensity to favor rewards that occur sooner in time (as opposed to waiting for long-term rewards); whereas the Cambridge gambling task appears to measure people's ability to inhibit desires to act immediately, referred to as response inhibition or action impulsivity. This method thus allows us to better understand how different behaviors are related, identifying whether two different tasks or models measure the same or different psychological processes.

Methods: Ninety-six substance-dependent individuals were recruited from a residential treatment program and divided into 1 of the 2 groups depending on whether they met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for pathological gambling (SDPG, n = 26) or not (SD, n = 70). Ninety-two controls were recruited from the community. Participants completed a decision-making task (modified Iowa Gambling Task), measures of impulsivity (Barratt Impulsivity Scale and Delay Discounting), and risk taking (Balloon Analog Risk Task). Decision making was analyzed using a computational model. We tested for group differences using analysis of covariance or Kruskal-Wallis and appropriate post-hoc tests. Results: The groups differed in decision-making parameters (P < 0.001) and self-reported impulsivity (P < 0.001). All post-hoc comparisons were significant on these measures, and indicated stepwise changes in controls, followed by SD, followed by SDPG, with SDPG performing worse on decision making and being more impulsive. Compared with SD, SDPG had greater drug severity (P < 0.001). No group differences were observed in delay discounting or risk taking. Conclusions: Compared with individuals with substance dependence without pathological gambling, those with both disorders demonstrated worse decision making and significantly more drug-related symptoms. When evaluating patients with substance dependence, clinicians should consider diagnostic assessments for gambling, as the co-occurrence of both disorders may impact clinical characteristics.

Overall, a lack of awareness may be an important aspect in understanding impaired social cognitive functioning and emotion-based learning observed in schizophrenia.

Researchers have thus needed to rely on alternative approaches that approximate drug-choice behavior or assess more general forms of decision-making, but whether these alternatives have relevance to real-world drug-taking that can inform clinical trials is not well-understood. In this mini-review, we (A) summarize several important modulatory variables that influence cocaine choice in nonhuman animals and non-treatment seeking humans; (B) discuss some of the ethical considerations that could arise if treatment-seekers are enrolled in drug-choice studies; (C) consider the efficacy of alternative procedures, including non-drug-related decision-making and 'simulated' drug-choice (a choice is made, but no drug is administered) to approximate drug choice; and (D) suggest opportunities for new translational work to bridge the current divide between preclinical and clinical research., Highlights:, * Here, we review research on cocaine-choice behavior (versus other reinforcers)., * Modulatory variables that influence cocaine choice are examined and evaluated., * However, ethics preclude use of these procedures in treatment-seekers., * Alternative procedures suitable for treatment-seekers are thus considered., * We conclude by suggesting opportunities for new translational work., (C) 2015Elsevier, Inc.",Duplicate DOI,Initial DOI Duplicate Removal,205,0,1.0,,,,,1308

Studies on acute cocaine administration suggest enhancement of response inhibition and psychomotor speed, while all other domains appear to be unaffected or not investigated adequately. Long-term effects of cocaine show a wide array of deteriorated cognitive functions, indicating that long term cocaine use is characterized by a general cognitive impairment across functions, rather than by specific cognitive deficits. Literature on long-term cocaine effects is more substantial than literature on acute effects. This comprehensive review outlines possible dissociations and similarities of acute vs. long-term cocaine effects in the human brain. Atherosclerosis after cocaine exposure may underlie cognitive dysfunction, suggesting involvement of multiple brain areas. Acute drug studies are important to the future development of addiction models., (C) 2013Elsevier, Inc.",Duplicate DOI,Initial DOI Duplicate Removal,142,0,2.0,,,,,1404

Deficits are typically found in complex task performance, whereas simple tasks may not be significantly compromised, perhaps because of little understood compensatory changes., Methods: We compared finger tapping with either hand at externally paced (EP) or maximal self-paced (SP) rates and concomitant brain activation in ten pairs of right-hand dominant, age-, and gender-matched, severe, uncomplicated ALC and normal controls (NC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)., Results: Mean tapping rates were not significantly different in ALC and NC for either task, but SP tapping variances were greater in ALC for both hands. SP tapping was more rapid with dominant hand (DH) than non-dominant hand (NDH) for both groups. EP and SP tapping with the non-dominant hand demonstrated significantly more activation in ALC than NC in the pre and postcentral gyri, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and the middle temporal gyrus. Areas activated only by ALC (not at all by NC) during NDH tapping included the inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. There were no significant group activation differences with DH tapping. No brain regions activated more in NC than ALC. SP tapping in contrast to EP activated fronto-cerebellar networks in NC, including postcentral gyrus, anterior cingulate, and the anterior lobe and vermis of the cerebellum, but only parietal precuneus in ALC., Conclusions: These findings with NDH finger tapping support previous reports of neurocognitive inefficiencies in ALC. Inferior frontal activation with EP in ALC, but not in NC, suggests engagement of regions needed for planning, organization, and impulse regulation; greater contralateral parietal lobe activation with SP in ALC may reflect right hemispheric impairments in visuospatial performance. Contrasting brain activation during SP and EP suggests that ALC may not have enlisted a fronto-cerebellar network as did NC but rather employed a higher order planning mode by recruiting parietal lobe functions to attain normal mean finger tapping rates.

In addition, obesity may result in an impaired flow motion with negative effects on the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to tissue and local hydraulic resistance., (C) 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins",Duplicate DOI,Initial DOI Duplicate Removal,319,0,1.0,,,,,1753

Subjects were divided into three groups: G1: FLI <20 (n = 608); G3: FLI >60 (n = 234), G2: intermediate group (n = 465). Compared to G1, G3 included more men (70% versus 24%) and people with impaired glucose tolerance (23% versus 5%). IMT increased with FLI (G3 = 0.64 +/- 0.08 versus G1 = 0.58 +/- 0.08 mm, P < 0.0001). FLI was associated with increased CHD risk (r = 0.48), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.33), alanine aminotransferase (r = 0.48), aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.25), systolic blood pressure (r = 0.39) and IMT (r = 0.30), and reduced insulin sensitivity (r = -0.43), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.50), adiponectin (r = -0.42), and physical activity (r = -0.16, all P < 0.0001). The correlations hold also in multivariate analysis after adjusting for age, gender, and recruiting center. Conclusion: In middle-age nondiabetic subjects, increased IMT, CHD risk, and reduced insulin sensitivity are associated with high values of FLI.

The relationship between fibrinogen and insulin and its precursors was significant in the overall population (r=0.20 for insulin and proinsulin; each P<0.001) but showed a more inconsistent pattern in subgroup analysis and after adjustments for demographic and metabolic variables. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that proinsulin (split products) but not fasting insulin significantly contributed to fibrinogen levels after adjustment for age, sex, clinic, and ethnicity. Decreased insulin sensitivity was independently associated with higher PAI-1 and fibrinogen levels. In summary, we were able to demonstrate an independent relationship of 2 crucial factors of hemostasis, fibrinogen and PAI-1, to insulin and its precursors. These findings may have important clinical implications in the risk assessment and prevention of macrovascular disease, not only in patients with overt diabetes but also in nondiabetic subjects who are hyperinsulinemic.

Our study aims to develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm-based suicide risk prediction model using cognition in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Participants comprised 52 depressed suicide attempters (DSA) and 61 depressed non-suicide attempters (DNS), and 98 healthy controls (HC). All participants were required to complete a series of questionnaires, the Suicide Stroop Task (SST) and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). The performance in IGT was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. ML with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classification algorithm and locally explanatory techniques assessed performance and relative importance of characteristics for predicting suicide attempts. Prediction performances were compared with the area under the curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA), and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Results: DSA and DNS preferred to select the card from disadvantageous decks (decks ""A"" + ""B"") under risky situation (p = 0.023) and showed a significantly poorer learning effect during the IGT (F = 2.331, p = 0.019) compared with HC. Performance of XGBoost model based on demographic and clinical characteristics was compared with that of the model created after adding cognition data (AUC, 0.779 vs. 0.819, p > 0.05). The net benefit of model was improved and cognition resulted in continuous reclassification improvement with NRI of 5.3%. Several clinical dimensions were significant predictors in the XGBoost classification algorithm. Limitations: A limited sample size and failure to include sufficient suicide risk factors in the predictive model. Conclusion: This study demonstrate that cognitive deficits may serve as an important risk factor to predict suicide attempts in patients with MDD. Combined with other demographic characteristics and attributes drawn from clinical questionnaires, cognitive function can improve the predictive effectiveness of the ML model. Additionally, explanatory ML models can help clinicians detect specific risk factors for each suicide attempter within MDD patients. These findings may be helpful for clinicians to detect those at high risk of suicide attempts quickly and accurately, and help them make proactive treatment decisions.

Stronger activations in these regions measured pre_discharge predicted longer abstinence after discharge in individuals with CUD. Dynamic causal modeling revealed an AIC_to_dACC_directed connectivity modulated by uncertainty in controls, but a dACC_to_AIC connectivity in CUD participants. This reversal was mostly driven by early relapsers (<30 days). Furthermore, CUD individuals who displayed a stronger AIC_to_dACC excitatory connection during uncertainty encoding remained abstinent for longer periods. These findings reveal a critical role of an AIC_driven, uncertainty_encoding neurocircuitry in protecting against relapse and promoting abstinence.

Relative impairments in the domains of working memory, planning and verbal memory remained stable, suggesting that these are enduring vulnerabilities associated with continued CU during young adulthood. Improvements in motivated decision-making were evident in both groups. In addition, CUs demonstrated relatively better performance on short-duration speeded tasks. An earlier age of CU onset was associated with poorer verbal learning and memory and planning performance over time. Conclusions: Verbal learning and memory and planning processes, as well as their neural correlates, merit further scrutiny within etiological models of cannabis-induced cognitive impairments.

Hierarchical Bayesian analyses demonstrated that EDA and HR acceleration responses during the decision phase were sensitive to the chances of winning. Interindividual differences in this peripheral reactivity during risky decision making were related to trait sensitivity to punishment and trait sensitivity to reward. Moreover, trial-by-trial variation in EDA and HR acceleration responses predicted a small portion of intraindividual variability in betting choices. Our results show that psychophysiological responses are sensitive to explicit risk and can help explain intraindividual heterogeneity in choice behavior.

However, very little is known about what distinguishes decision making by individuals with different disorders or the neuropsychological processes or brain systems underlying these. This is the focus of the current review. Scope and methodology We first propose a neuroeconomic model of the decision-making process with separate stages for the prechoice evaluation of expected utility of future options; choice execution and postchoice management; the appraisal of outcome against expectation; and the updating of value estimates to guide future decisions. According to the proposed model, decision making is mediated by neuropsychological processes operating within three domains: (a) self-referential processes involved in autobiographical reflection on past, and prospection about future, experiences; (b) executive functions, such as working memory, inhibition, and planning, that regulate the implementation of decisions; and (c) processes involved in value estimation and outcome appraisal and learning. These processes are underpinned by the interplay of multiple brain networks, especially medial and lateralized cortical components of the default mode network, dorsal corticostriatal circuits underpinning higher order cognitive and behavioral control, and ventral frontostriatal circuits, connecting to brain regions implicated in emotion processing, that control valuation and learning processes. Findings and conclusion Based on clinical insights and considering each of the decision-making stages in turn, we outline disorder-specific hypotheses about impaired decision making in four childhood disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD), conduct disorder ( CD), depression, and anxiety. We hypothesize that decision making in ADHD is deficient (i.e. inefficient, insufficiently reflective, and inconsistent) and impulsive (biased toward immediate over delayed alternatives). In CD, it is reckless and insensitive to negative consequences. In depression, it is disengaged, perseverative, and pessimistic, while in anxiety, it is hesitant, risk-averse, and self-deprecating. A survey of current empirical indications related to these disorder-specific hypotheses highlights the limited and fragmentary nature of the evidence base and illustrates the need for a major research initiative in decision making in childhood disorders. The final section highlights a number of important additional general themes that need to be considered in future research.

As shown both in choices and model parameters, individuals who showed relatively better learning of rewards for charity ÃÂÃÂ compared to themselves ÃÂÃÂ were more likely to engage in pro-social behavior outside of a laboratory setting indicated by self-report. Overall rates of reward learning, however, did not predict individual differences in pro-social tendencies. These results support the idea that biases toward learning about social rewards are associated with one's altruistic tendencies.

These findings suggest that environmental responsiveness may be an important determinant to close the intention-behaviour gap for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Young adults fail to adhere to behaviours indicative of healthy lifestyle. Self-regulation and behavioural prepotency add unique variance to the prediction of health behaviour. The influence of these factors is thought to vary according to environmental context. What does this study add? Individuals who feel supported by the environment are more likely to maintain a healthy lifestyle than those who feel distracted by the environment. Behavioural prepotency is predictive of healthy lifestyle for individuals who feel 'supported' by the environment.

We find that there are many commonalities in terms of the brain regions identified across these systems and, as we would expect, all are sensitive to the influence of, or function differently in the context of, depression and adverse early experience. It is likely that the similarity and cross-talk between maternal, affect and stress systems, observed behaviorally, hormonally and in the context of brain function, allows for mood disturbance and early adverse experiences to have a significant impact on the quality of mothering and the motivation to mother.

Participants selected more frequently from disadvantageous decks, which yield larger immediate monetary gains with a larger long-term monetary losses (Mean NET_=_-9.51, SD_=_26.70), but avoided decks yielding frequent monetary losses (Mean GLF_=_10.10, SD_=_26.70). Consistently, participants selected most frequently from a deck yielding the most immediate monetary gains and the least frequent monetary losses compared to other decks (ps_<_0.05). Based upon their selections, participants lost a significant amount of money (M_=_-$1,493.22, SD_=_$1,182.26). IGT outcomes were differentially associated with cognitive functioning (rs_=_-0.26 to 0.47), psychiatric symptom severity (rs_=_-0.41 to 0.37), and impulsivity (rs_=_-0.47 to 0.28; all ps_=_0.003-0.98). Findings can guide future research, as well as guide competency restoration and decision-making interventions, for this population.

We build on existing IG research by presenting a revised specification IG 2.0 for encoding and analyzing institutional design that responds to representational necessities and analytical opportunities within and beyond policy and administrative domains.

The lack of complete overlap between BAs and SUDs suggests that investigating the cognitive and neurophysiological features of BAs to create individual NIBS protocols that target risk-factors associated specifically with BAs, might be more effective than transferring protocols from SUDs to BAs. Individualizing NIBS protocols to target specific risk-factors associated with each BA might help to improve treatment interventions for BAs. (Am J Addict 2019;00:1-23).

Although the majority of meta-analyzed studies demonstrated significant differences between patients with OUD and controls, the average raw scores for patients with OUD in these studies typically fell within the normal range.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The pattern of neuropsychological performance among patients with OUD appears to reflect mild generalized cognitive dysfunction, with a large effect in complex psychomotor abilities.

However, cocaine appears to be more associated with working memory impairments, which are typically frontally mediated, while methamphetamine appears to be more associated with memory impairments that are linked with temporal and parietal lobe dysfunction.

However, very little is known about what distinguishes decision making by individuals with different disorders or the neuropsychological processes or brain systems underlying these. This is the focus of the current review. Scope and methodology We first propose a neuroeconomic model of the decision-making process with separate stages for the prechoice evaluation of expected utility of future options; choice execution and postchoice management; the appraisal of outcome against expectation; and the updating of value estimates to guide future decisions. According to the proposed model, decision making is mediated by neuropsychological processes operating within three domains: (a) self-referential processes involved in autobiographical reflection on past, and prospection about future, experiences; (b) executive functions, such as working memory, inhibition, and planning, that regulate the implementation of decisions; and (c) processes involved in value estimation and outcome appraisal and learning. These processes are underpinned by the interplay of multiple brain networks, especially medial and lateralized cortical components of the default mode network, dorsal corticostriatal circuits underpinning higher order cognitive and behavioral control, and ventral frontostriatal circuits, connecting to brain regions implicated in emotion processing, that control valuation and learning processes. Findings and conclusion Based on clinical insights and considering each of the decision-making stages in turn, we outline disorder-specific hypotheses about impaired decision making in four childhood disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD), conduct disorder ( CD), depression, and anxiety. We hypothesize that decision making in ADHD is deficient (i.e. inefficient, insufficiently reflective, and inconsistent) and impulsive (biased toward immediate over delayed alternatives). In CD, it is reckless and insensitive to negative consequences. In depression, it is disengaged, perseverative, and pessimistic, while in anxiety, it is hesitant, risk-averse, and self-deprecating. A survey of current empirical indications related to these disorder-specific hypotheses highlights the limited and fragmentary nature of the evidence base and illustrates the need for a major research initiative in decision making in childhood disorders.

In a hospital research setting, physically and mentally healthy individuals with high (n= 18) and low (n= 13) self-reported dream awareness completed a computerised cognitive task that involved reality monitoring based on familiarity across a series of task runs. Results. Signal detection theory analysis revealed a more liberal acceptance bias in those with high dream awareness, consistent with the notion of overlap in the perception of dreams, imagination and reality. Conclusions. We discuss the implications of these results for models of reality monitoring and psychosis with a particular focus on the role of vmPFC in default-mode brain function, model-based reinforcement learning and the phenomenology of dreaming and waking consciousness.

Although developing treatments for these behaviors is important, few predictive animal models exist. Inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT) can model profiles of altered motor activity and exploration seen in patients with BD.

Objectives: We hypothesized that (1) C57BL/6 mice could adopt the 'safe' choice options in the IGT and (2) DAT inhibition would alter risk preference. Methods: Mice were trained in the IGT to a stable risk-preference and then administered the norepinephrine/DAT inhibitor amphetamine, or the more selective DAT inhibitors modafinil or GBR12909. Results: Mice developed a preference for the 'safe' option, which was potentiated by amphetamine administration.

Conclusions: The rodent IGT can measure different impulse-related behaviors and differentiate similarly acting BD-related drugs. The contrasting effects of amphetamine and modafinil in mice are similar to effects in rats and humans in corresponding IGT tasks, supporting the translational validity of the task. GBR12909 and modafinil elicited similar behaviors in the IGT, likely through a shared mechanism.

Consistent with the hypothesized role for the hippocampus in this generalization, functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and hippocampus was modulated, across participants, by the ability of the augmented model to capture participants' choice. Our results thus point toward an interactive model in which striatal reinforcement learning systems may employ relational representations typically associated with the hippocampus.

We find that there are many commonalities in terms of the brain regions identified across these systems and, as we would expect, all are sensitive to the influence of, or function differently in the context of, depression and adverse early experience. It is likely that the similarity and cross-talk between maternal, affect and stress systems, observed behaviorally, hormonally and in the context of brain function, allows for mood disturbance and early adverse experiences to have a significant impact on the quality of mothering and the motivation to mother.

Second, counseling methods could be incorporated into curriculum, and teacher should increasing frequency chats with students to understanding what they are thinking, doing and engaging in. The last but not least, it is important for teachers to observe interactions between students during breaking time in school.

Results: Neurobiological studies have shown that symptoms and behaviors of BPD are partly associated with alterations in basic neurocognitive processes, involving glutamatergic, dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems. In addition, neuroimaging studies in BPD patients indicated differences in the volume and activity of specific brain regions related to emotion and impulse control, such as the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdala and hippocampus (Table I).

However, the neural mechanisms underlying this relation are still unknown. To address this question, we employed voxel_based morphometry (VBM) analysis and resting_state functional connectivity (rs_FC) to examine the influence of trait anxiety on risk_taking. We theorized that trait anxiety may affect risk_taking via negative prospection during episodic future thinking, which is known to be mediated by episodic memory systems including the hippocampus. We measured risk_taking using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) and found that risk_taking in this task was negatively correlated with trait anxiety. The VBM results suggested a positive correlation between trait anxiety and grey matter volumes in the hippocampus, consistent with previous results. Functional connectivity results indicated that functional connectivity between a right hippocampus cortex (RHPC) seed region and left insula (LInsula) was positively correlated with trait anxiety scores but negatively correlated with risk_taking. Critically, mediation analysis showed that trait anxiety played a completely mediating role in the relation between the functional connectivity of RHPC_LInsula and risk_taking. These results suggested that trait anxiety can affect risk_taking via episodic future thinking mechanisms subserved by the hippocampal cortex acting in concert with emotional and motivational control mechanisms subserved by the insular cortex. The neural mechanism through which trait anxiety affects risk_taking remains elusive. Our findings indicated that trait anxiety may affect risk_taking via the right hippocampus cortex (RHPC) and its connectivity with left insula (LInsula). Thus, the current study revealed that high trait anxiety may result in risk aversion through interactions between episodic future thinking and negative emotions subserved by hippocampalÃÂÃÂinsular coupling.

When applied to these tasks, our approached showed that both tasks are predictive of substance use in heroin-, amphetamine-, and multiple-substance-dependent individuals. However, the two tasks appear to be measuring different dimensions or subtypes of impulsivity: The delay discounting task measures choice impulsivity, which is related to self-report measures of substance use and propensity to favor rewards that occur sooner in time (as opposed to waiting for long-term rewards); whereas the Cambridge gambling task appears to measure people's ability to inhibit desires to act immediately, referred to as response inhibition or action impulsivity.
